/**
 * `POST /identify` — upserts the logged-in customer into the CRM as a Contact
 * (`CONTACT_IDENTIFY_CONTRACT.md`; core's `IdentitySync` seam).
 *
 * Unlike the four factories above this one takes no type parameter, because the
 * seam runs the other way. Those return a core type this package cannot name,
 * so they are generic and cast on the way out. Here core's type is an
 * *argument*, and a locally-declared parameter accepts any structurally
 * compatible profile without a generic. The return type is not core's at all:
 * `IdentitySync.sync` resolves to `void` and this resolves to the receipt, an
 * intentional mismatch the widget bridges in one line at the call site (§3.3,
 * AMENDED). Do not collapse it — core has no use for the receipt, and
 * discarding it here would throw away the only signal a caller could log.
 *
 * Nothing is retried in this adapter. `RestClient` has no backoff by design and
 * the identify retry lives in core, where the jitter and timer seams are; the
 * `READ_BACK_ATTEMPTS` loop above is scoped to one specific read-back and is
 * not a pattern to generalize.
