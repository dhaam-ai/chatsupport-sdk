// GUARD 5 — PRD §15: the public barrel exports no internals.
//
// ── Read `src/index.test.ts` before adding anything here ─────────────────
//
// T13 already guards this, and this file does NOT restate it. That test
// enumerates ~25 forbidden names (`SendQueue`, `ConnectionController`,
// `ChatStore`, `scrubCredentials`, …) and asserts none of them are exported,
// plus positive checks that the intended §6.4/§6.5 surface IS exported. All of
// that is left where it is.
//
// This file closes the one gap a denylist structurally cannot close.
//
// A denylist answers "did any of these 25 known internals leak?". The failure
// it cannot see is the export nobody thought to add to the list: a new engine
// class written next year, an internal helper re-exported for a binding's
// convenience, or a `export *` added to `index.ts` that drags a module's whole
// surface out at once. Every one of those passes the denylist — the names are
// not on it — and every one is the same mistake the denylist exists to catch.
//
// An allowlist inverts that. It fails on ANY change to the exported surface,
// known or unknown, so a new export cannot ship without someone editing this
// list and, in doing so, deciding on purpose that the name is public API.
//
// ── Why the list is written out rather than derived ──────────────────────
//
// The obvious shortcut — read `index.ts`, extract its exports, compare to what
// the module exports — is a test that compares the code to itself. It passes
// no matter what is exported, because both sides change together. The names
// below are therefore typed out, and updating them is meant to be a deliberate
// act.
//
// WHEN THIS TEST FAILS, DO NOT JUST PASTE THE NEW LIST IN. The question it is
// asking is "should a consumer of `@dhaam-ccrm/core` be able to reach this?"
// Adding a name here is an API commitment; removing one is a breaking change.
