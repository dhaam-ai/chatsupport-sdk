// The connection state machine — PRD §8, §10.4-10.6, §7.5.
//
// Transport (T7) moves bytes. This module decides *when*: when to open a
// socket, when to retry, when to refresh credentials, and when to stop. It
// owns `ChatState.connectionState` and nothing else in the state tree except
// `lastError`.
//
//
// Re-entrancy, and the one interface assumption this module is built around
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `WebSocketTransport.connect()` closes and supersedes any existing socket,
// and it does so by synthesizing a close *synchronously, from inside the
// call*. `transport.close()` does the same. So both of this module's own
// outbound calls can re-enter `#handleClose` before they return, and
// reconnecting from inside `onClose` — the normal path — puts a second
// `connect()` on the stack inside the first.
//
// This module does not try to detect that with a flag. Instead it leans on a
// property the transport already guarantees: **every close this module caused
// is reported with `cause: 'local'`** (transport/close.ts: "A `local` close is
// reported retryable because it is T8's own doing — T8 knows it asked").
// `#handleClose` returns immediately on `cause: 'local'`, so a superseded or
// self-closed socket can never schedule a retry, emit `disconnected`, or move
// the state machine. The code that asked for the close owns the resulting
// state, and it is already on the stack.
//
// The complementary half is that **no reconnect is ever synchronous**. Every
// retry goes through the injected `schedule()`, even when the computed delay
// is 0, so `onClose` always returns before a new socket exists. That is what
// keeps the "do not assume `onClose` returns before your new socket exists"
// hazard out of reach rather than merely handled.
//
// ⚠️ INTERFACE ASSUMPTION — `WebSocketLike.close()` must not synchronously
// invoke `onclose`.
//
//   `WebSocketLike` (transport/socket.ts) does not enforce this, and nothing
//   in the type system can. Both shipped implementations satisfy it: a real
//   browser/Node `WebSocket` dispatches `close` asynchronously, and
//   `StubWebSocket` records the call without firing anything. But the
//   interface exists precisely so third parties (React Native bridges, test
//   doubles) can implement it, and one that called `onclose` synchronously
//   from `close()` would re-enter `WebSocketTransport.#finish` from inside
//   `#tryClose`.
//
//   This module is written so that it survives a violation rather than
//   depending on the assumption: such a re-entrant close still arrives with
//   `cause: 'local'` (the transport sets `#cause` *before* calling
//   `socket.close()` on every path), so `#handleClose` discards it either
//   way, and `disconnect()` moves to `closed` on its own authority
//   afterwards. The assumption is documented here because this is the layer
//   whose invariants would be the first to visibly break if it stopped
//   holding — see the T8 report, which flags it for whoever owns
//   `WebSocketLike`.
//
//
// What this module deliberately does not do
// -----------------------------------------
//   - Compute backoff delays. backoff/ owns the formula (§8.2); this schedules
//     what it returns.
//   - Validate frames or correlate acks. transport/ owns both.
//   - Apply messages, presence, or the session snapshot to state. Those go
//     down the `onFrame` chain, exactly as `PresenceCoordinator` expects.
//   - Queue or replay unacked sends. That is §9.1's offline queue.
//
// §14: no token value is ever logged, put in an error message, or written to
// the store.
