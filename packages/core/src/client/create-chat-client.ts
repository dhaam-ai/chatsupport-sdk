// createChatClient — PRD §6.1. The front door: every T7-T12 module gets
// constructed and wired together exactly once, here.
//
// ── Construction order, and the two forward-reference patterns it needs ──
//
// Most of this file is straight-line construction. Two spots are not, and
// both are documented inline where they happen:
//
//   1. `messageController` <-> `queue`. `MessageController` takes `enqueue`
//      as a function (messages/types.ts's `EnqueueSend`), not the `SendQueue`
//      itself, because the queue needs the controller's `onAck`/`onFailed`
//      callbacks at *its* construction — so whichever is built first has to
//      reference the other before it exists. Explicit type annotations on
//      both `const` declarations break the TS7022 circular-inference error
//      this would otherwise produce; see queue/send-queue.ts's `SendQueue`
//      doc and messages/types.ts's `EnqueueSend` doc for why neither module
//      restructures around this instead.
//   2. `realTransport` / `messageControllerRef`. `dispatchFrame` and
//      `emitIntent` are both built *before* the objects they call into
//      (`WebSocketTransport`, `MessageController`) exist, because
//      `ConnectionController`'s constructor calls the transport factory
//      synchronously and needs `onFrame` wired in before that happens. Both
//      are plain closures over a `let` assigned later — safe because neither
//      closure is *invoked* until a consumer calls `connect()`/`sendMessage()`
//      /etc., well after this function has finished wiring everything and
//      returned.
//
// Nothing here does HTTP, reads `window`/`document`, or imports a framework.
// The only globals touched are `WebSocket` (lazily, inside the transport,
// only at connect time) and `Date`/`setTimeout` (only as the *default* clock
// and scheduler — every module already accepts an injected override).

  // containing ':' (its own delimiter), precisely to stop two different
  // namespace/key pairs from colliding on the same resulting key.
  //
  // ── …and by WHO IS USING IT, which is the half that was missing ──────────
  //
  // The publishable key identifies the TENANT, not the person. One browser
  // routinely holds more than one identity against it: a host page mints a
  // per-browser guest id for a visitor and swaps it for the real user id when
  // they sign in, then rebuilds the client. With only the key in the
  // namespace, everything below is inherited across that swap by whoever
  // comes next, and neither thing survives contact with the server:
  //
  //   • `selectedSession` — the new identity re-joins a session belonging to
  //     the old one. `session.join` is refused (SESSION_NOT_FOUND, correctly)
  //     and `GET /chat/sessions/{id}/messages` answers 404 for the same
  //     reason. Recoverable — the selection is forgotten and the caller's own
  //     session is loaded instead — but only after a failed round trip and an
  //     error the host's tracker sees on every sign-in.
  //   • `sendQueue` — worse, and not recoverable. `message.send` carries no
  //     author; the server attributes it to whoever is connected. A message a
  //     GUEST typed offline, still queued when they sign in, is delivered as
  //     the signed-in user, into that user's session.
  //
  // So the identity joins the namespace. The cost is a one-time orphaning of
  // anything queued under the old two-level key on upgrade; that is strictly
  // better than delivering it as the wrong person.
  //
  // The two levels stop one short of the identity on purpose, and everything
  // that must not cross an identity swap adds the third level below. The
  // identify dedup record (section 7c) is the one thing that legitimately
  // lives at THIS level: it holds a hash and a timestamp, no PII and no
  // content, and the hash folds the user id in, so a record another identity
  // wrote can never match — it can only be overwritten, which costs one
  // redundant idempotent POST. Keeping it here is what bounds this feature to
  // a single stored record per tenant forever, however many people sign in on

   * Makes the SOCKET's join and the STORE's session name the same
   * conversation again, after a join that did not take.
   *
   * The divergence is real and it is silent. A switch tears the socket down;
   * the fresh `connection.hello` carries no session id, so the server resolves
   * the customer's most-recently-updated ACTIVE session on its own and the
   * `connection.ack` routinely names a THIRD conversation — which
   * `switchTarget` then (correctly) refuses to paint. If the explicit
   * `session.join` that was supposed to correct that is REFUSED, nothing moves
   * `joinedSessionId` — also correct, and by itself the whole bug: the socket
   * is left joined to the third session while `ChatState` still describes the
   * one being left, and neither side is wrong on its own terms.
   *
   * What that costs the customer is everything. `SendQueueOptions.joinedSession`
   * scopes the drain to `joinedSessionId`, and every entry is stamped with the
   * session it was composed in, so each message they type is durably queued,
   * correctly addressed — and never sent. `connectionState` reads `connected`,
   * the composer clears, the bubble says "queued", and no error is raised
   * anywhere. They are muted with no way to find out.
   *
   * So the disagreement is closed rather than narrowed. One `session.join` for
   * the session actually on screen puts the socket back where the customer is
   * looking, and the queue drains into it; the failed switch is still reported
   * to whoever asked for it, unchanged.
   *
   * If even that is refused, this connection cannot reach any conversation the
   * client is able to show. Rather than leave a session on screen that cannot
   * be sent to, the session is cleared — `sendMessage` then fails loudly with
   * `NoActiveSessionError` instead of queueing into silence, `lastError` says
   * what happened, and a binding has an empty state to render. The next
   * `connection.ack` repaints from whatever the server resolves.
