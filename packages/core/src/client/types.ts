// The public client contract — PRD §6.1-§6.5, assembled here because no
// single T7-T12 module owns the whole surface. See create-chat-client.ts for
// the wiring and the T13 report (delivered as this task's final response) for
// every judgment call this file embodies.
//
// ── Where this file's shape diverges from §6.1's literal text, and why ──
//
// §6.1's `ChatClientConfig` lists six fields: `publishableKey`, `getToken`,
// `apiUrl?`, `wsUrl?`, `storage?`, `logger?`, `protocolVersion?`. Building the
// client surfaced seams none of those six can satisfy:
//
//   - `localSender` (required). `ChatSession` carries both a `customer` and
//     an `assignedAgent` (state/types.ts), and nothing in §6.1's config lets
//     core tell which one this process is. Guessing CUSTOMER would mislabel
//     every message an agent-side embed sends (see messages/types.ts's
//     `LocalSender` doc). Required, not optional — a silently-wrong sender
//     label is worse than a construction-time type error.
//   - `history` (required). `MessageController` needs a `MessageHistorySource`
//     (messages/types.ts) and core does no HTTP itself (§4: network
//     *implementations* are explicitly NOT core's to own — only the
//     interface is). Pagination is core enough to nearly every integration
//     that an unconfigured default would just move the failure to the first
//     `loadOlderMessages()` call instead of to construction.
//   - `uploader` (optional). Same reasoning, but `sendAttachment()` is not
//     every integration's concern, so this is optional — omitting it costs
//     nothing until `sendAttachment()` is actually called, at which point it
//     rejects loudly. That check runs at the `ChatClient` boundary rather
//     than only inside the uploader stub passed to `MessageController`:
//     `MessageController#sendAttachment` never rejects on an upload failure
//     at all (it reports through `lastError`/the `error` event, §6.4), so a
//     stub alone would make "no uploader configured" indistinguishable from
//     a real runtime upload failure.
//   - `sessionActions` (optional). `reopenSession`/`closeSession` (§6.2) have
//     no WebSocket frame type in §7.3's catalog at all — confirmed by
//     openapi/chat-api.yaml's `/sessions/{id}/reopen` and `/sessions/{id}/close`
//     paths, both REST-only "same as v1". No T7-T12 module defines a seam for
//     them, so this file adds one, following the exact shape of `history`/
//     `uploader`: an interface core does not implement, only calls.
//   - `sessionSummarySource` (optional, T10). Backs `listSessions()` — the
//     session-picker's data source. Same shape of seam as `sessionActions`:
//     `GET /chat/sessions/customer` is REST-only, core does no HTTP, so this
//     is an interface core calls, never implements.
//   - `webSocketFactory`, `schedule`, `now` (all optional, advanced). Needed
//     to construct a deterministic, network-free end-to-end test through the
//     public API — and, not incidentally, to run on a React Native JS engine
//     whose `WebSocket` global (§11) may need a non-default factory. Every
//     T7-T12 module already injects its clock/scheduler/socket rather than
//     reading a global; these three fields are the only way `createChatClient`
//     can pass a caller's override down through construction.
//   - `pageSize`, `queueRetention` (optional). Direct pass-throughs to
//     documented override points `messages/types.ts` (`DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`)
//     and `queue/types.ts` (`SendQueueRetention`, "Open Question 9 ... ship
//     with a documented default rather than blocking on it") already declare
//     as intentionally tunable, not architectural.
//
// `apiUrl` is kept for §6.1 conformance even though core never reads it: with
// every REST seam injected (`history`, `uploader`, `sessionActions`), core
// itself makes zero HTTP calls, so there is nothing here for `apiUrl` to
// parameterize. It is accepted so a consumer can keep one config object and
// hand `apiUrl` to their own adapter construction; see the T13 report for the
// full "inject vs. default" reasoning, which cites openapi/chat-api.yaml's
// `servers` block (`{apiUrl}/chat-services/api/v1` — corrected mid-build from
// `{apiUrl}/v1`) as a concrete reason not to bake a REST base path into core.

 * Backs `client.reopenSession()`/`client.closeSession()` (§6.2).

 * Both are REST-only (`POST /chat-services/api/v1/chat/sessions/{id}/reopen`
 * and `/close`) — "There is no WebSocket frame type for this action in the T1
 * catalog" per the spec's own description of each route. The unprefixed
 * `/sessions/{id}/…` paths this comment used to name are served by nothing;
 * corrected in the spec and in `@dhaam-ccrm/rest`, and noted here only so the
 * comment stops pointing at dead routes.
 * Core does no HTTP (§4), so — exactly like `MessageHistorySource` and
 * `AttachmentUploader` — this is an interface core calls, never implements.
 *
 * Both methods return the REST `ChatSession` shape (openapi `ChatSession`
 * schema), which is field-for-field state/types.ts's `ChatSession` and,
 * unlike the WebSocket `SessionSnapshot` (protocol/domain.ts), carries full
 * `Profile` objects (`displayName`/`email`/`avatarUrl`) — so a configured
 * `sessionActions` also happens to be the one path that gives
 * `ChatState.session` fully-accurate participant profiles, rather than the
 * best-effort placeholders `session.ts`'s WS-only mapping produces.
 *
 * ── Reporting a change the server applied but could not confirm ──
 *
 * An implementation may need more than one round trip to produce the full
 * `ChatSession` (the REST adapter does: a mutating POST, then a read of the
 * full session). If the mutation lands and the follow-up fails, rejecting
 * plainly tells core the action did not happen, when in fact it did — and
 * `ChatState.session` is then quietly wrong.
 *
 * An implementation in that position should reject with an error carrying
 * `sessionMutationApplied: true`. Core checks for that property structurally,
 * imports nothing to do so, and responds by surfacing a `ChatError` through
 * `lastError` and the `error` event before re-throwing, so the staleness is at
 * least visible. Anything without the flag is passed through untouched.
 *
 * An implementation that retries such a failure must retry only the read, never
 * the mutation: `closeSession` is not idempotent on this service.

   *      history (§12.5), and carrying it across makes the next
   *      `connection.hello` ask to resume from a `seq` the new session has
   *      never reached, which the v2 endpoint refuses NON-RETRYABLY and which

   *      opened;
   *   5. `session.join` is sent on it and its ack awaited — one join, with
   *      nothing else in flight to race it. It is needed because
   *      `connection.hello` carries no session id, so the server resolves the
   *      customer's most-recently-updated ACTIVE session on its own, which for
   *      a picked CLOSED/RESOLVED conversation is a different one;
   *   6. and page one of the new session's history is loaded.
   *
   * **The session on screen does not change until step 6's snapshot lands, and
   * when it does, it changes completely.** `ChatState.session` and every
   * per-session projection — `messages`, `pagination`, `typing`,
   * `unreadCount`, `readWatermarks`, `deliveredWatermarks`, `presence`,
   * `lastError` — move in ONE `setState`. For the whole of the operation the
   * outgoing conversation stays intact and self-consistent: the header keeps
   * naming it, the transcript keeps showing it, `sendMessage` keeps composing
   * into it. There is no interval in which one conversation's identity is
   * readable against another's data, in either direction. `pastSessions` is
   * deliberately kept across the change: it is a list *about* other sessions,
   * not state *of* this one.
   *
   * **Queued sends for the outgoing session are PRESERVED, not failed.** Each
   * one carries the session it was composed in
   * (`MessageSendPayload.sessionId`) and the queue refuses to pump any session
   * but the joined one, so an entry cannot be misdelivered into the
   * conversation being opened. It waits instead, goes out the moment its own
   * session is joined again, and is still bounded by §9.6 retention. (Contrast
   * `startNewSession`, which fails them: there the session really is ending.)
   *
   * **Resolves only once that first page is in `ChatState.messages`**, so a
   * caller can show a spinner for exactly the duration of the switch and know
   * the transcript is on screen when it settles. Awaiting the `session.join`
   * ack alone would not be enough: that ack is `EmptyAckData` (`{ ok: true }`,
   * protocol/frames.ts) and carries no snapshot — the session itself arrives
   * as a separate `session.updated` push the server volunteers afterwards.
   *
   * **Costs one extra round trip** — the handshake on the new connection —
   * versus an in-place join. That is the price of the guarantee above, paid
   * deliberately.
   *
   * **Rejects with {@link SessionSwitchError}** if the server refused the
   * join, the snapshot never arrived, or the reconnect it needs was aborted
   * (by `disconnect()`, `startNewSession()`, or a newer switch that is not
   * this one). The same failure is also written to `ChatState.lastError` and
   * emitted as `error`, so either style of handling works — but the promise is
   * the one that tells a picker that *this particular row* did not open. Do
   * not call it and drop the promise on the floor.
   *
   * **A failed switch changes nothing.** Nothing was torn down in state to
   * begin with, so there is no rollback and no recovery fetch: the customer is
   * still looking at the conversation they never left, with its transcript
   * intact and its `lastError` naming what went wrong.
   *
   * **Two rapid switches**: the later one wins outright. It aborts the
   * earlier one's reconnect, so that one resolves quietly rather than
   * reporting a failure nobody asked about, and no page it fetched can reach
   * the winner's transcript.
   *
   * Switching to the session already on screen is a no-op that resolves
   * immediately: no teardown, no frame, no refetch.
   *
   * The chosen session is remembered through `ChatClientConfig.storage`, so a
   * page reload re-joins it rather than falling back to whatever session the
   * server picks for a `connection.hello` — which carries no session id at
   * all, leaving the server to re-resolve the customer's most recently
   * updated ACTIVE session. That is very often not the one being read, since
   * a session picked out of a picker is usually CLOSED or RESOLVED. Supply a
   * durable adapter (`createBrowserStorageAdapter()`) for that to survive a
   * real reload; the default `MemoryStorageAdapter` does not.
   *
   * `v2/handlers.ts` already ownership-checks `session.join` and already
   * accepts a TERMINAL session (`CLOSED`/`RESOLVED`) — switching to a past,
   * closed conversation is exactly that path, not a special case this SDK
   * adds. Joining a terminal session does not, by itself, reopen it and does
   * not optimistically flip `status` locally — this client never guesses at
   * a status the server has not confirmed (§9.4). Reopening only happens if
   * the customer then sends a message into it: node T1 (backend) reactivates
   * a terminal session to `WAITING_FOR_AGENT` on the next CUSTOMER message,
   * behind `FEATURE_SESSION_REACTIVATE_ON_CUSTOMER_MESSAGE` (default OFF),
   * and this client only ever learns that happened from the resulting
   * `session.updated` — never assumes it.
   *
   * A `statusChange` event is NOT emitted for the new session's status, even
   * when it differs from the old one's: §6.5 defines that event as "the
   * session you are in changed status", and a different session having a
   * different status is a different chat, not a change.
   *
   * ── The SWITCHED-close pairing ──
   *
   * That same reactivation may ALSO close the customer's other still-active
   * session with `closeReason: 'SWITCHED'` server-side (one customer, one
   * live conversation). This client can therefore observe one `session.closed`
   * (for the session just left) and one `session.updated`/reactivation (for
   * the session just switched into) in either order. Both are handled so
   * that pair can never corrupt the session just switched into: `SWITCHED`
   * is a parked close (§12.5) so the old session's queued sends are left
   * alone rather than failed, and the `sessionClosed` event and `closedAt`
   * stamp only ever apply to whichever session `frame.d.sessionId` actually
   * names, never to whatever happens to be `ChatState.session` at the moment
   * the frame arrives. A customer who has already switched will not be told
   * their NEW chat just closed because their OLD one, elsewhere, did.
