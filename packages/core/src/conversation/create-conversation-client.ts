// createConversationClient — the keyless (staff/party) front door.
//
// ── The one thing to know before reading ─────────────────────────────────
//
// This file adds a surface. It does not modify one. `create-chat-client.ts`,
// `ChatClientConfig`, `ChatState`, `switchSession`, `commitSession`,
// `perSessionReset`, `mount()` and `singleton.ts` are all untouched by the
// whole of this work, and that is a stronger guarantee than "the suite is
// green": the customer path is produced by literally the same bytes of source
// as before, so there is nothing for a regression to hide in.
//
// ── Zero lines of connection code change, and why that was checkable ─────
//
// Everything keyless already existed inside `ConnectionController`; nothing had
// ever constructed it that way. Verified on HEAD before writing a line here:
//
//   • `ConnectionControllerOptions.publishableKey` is already optional
//     (`connection/types.ts`), documented as "OMITTED for a STAFF connection".
//   • `#openSocket` already omits it by conditional spread rather than sending
//     `undefined` (`connection/controller.ts:489`) — which matters, because
//     under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` those are different values and
//     `validate.ts` rejects `''` precisely so a blank key cannot become a
//     second route into the server's staff branch.
//   • `#customerAckViolation` already returns `null` when no key was sent
//     (`connection/controller.ts:650`), so a session-less `connection.ack` —
//     which is what the staff flow answers with — is admitted rather than
//     treated as a protocol violation.
//
// So this file constructs the existing engine with the argument omitted. That
// is the entire keyless mechanism.
//
// ── …and the same is true one layer up ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The two addressing decisions this surface had to make — what an OUTBOUND
// frame carries, and what happens to an INBOUND frame the wire cannot address —
// are stated in full in `addressing.ts`'s header. Read that file first; it is
// the only place either decision is made.
//
// The conversation runtime underneath (`runtime.ts`, `registry.ts`) reuses the
// SHIPPED `MessageController`, `PresenceCoordinator` and `SendQueue`
// unmodified, each over a `ChatStore` of the conversation's own. So this whole
// surface still edits ZERO existing runtime files: `git diff` over
// `client/`, `connection/`, `messages/`, `presence/`, `queue/`, `state/` and
// `widget/` is empty, which is a stronger statement than "the suite is green".
