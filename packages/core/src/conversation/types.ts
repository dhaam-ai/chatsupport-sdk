// The multi-role conversation surface — public types.
//
// ── What this module is, and what it is NOT ──────────────────────────────
//
// `createChatClient` serves ONE surface: a customer, holding ONE session,
// authenticated by a publishable key. The server picks its whole flow on that
// key's PRESENCE (`handlers.ts` branches on `conn.staffSurface`, and its own
// comment is explicit that "the SURFACE decides that and not the role"), and a
// connection that sends no key gets the other flow: N live sessions that
// accumulate rather than evict.
//
// A merchant, a manager and an admin observer all need that second flow. None
// of them has a publishable key — they arrive holding a dh-auth `id_token` the
// host already has.
//
// This is a SEPARATE factory rather than a widened `ChatClientConfig`, and that
// is the single most important decision in the whole design:
//
//   `publishableKey: process.env.PK` evaluating to `undefined` must not
//   silently become a keyless staff connection. `validate.ts` closed exactly
//   that hole on the wire by rejecting `''`; widening the customer config would
//   reopen it one layer up.
//
// The consequence, and the contract this work is held to: `create-chat-client.ts`
// and `ChatClientConfig` receive ZERO edits. Nothing here can change what a
// customer install does, because nothing here is on that path.
//
// ── Scope of THIS slice ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Keyless boot (slice 1) plus ONE live conversation on it: `open()` sends
// `session.join` carrying `resumeFrom`, applies the `SessionJoinAckData
// { seq, replay }` that comes back, waits for the session snapshot the server
// pushes after it, and reads page one of history through an injected seam.
// `sendMessage()` then sends into that conversation with an optimistic echo,
// and its inbound messages land on its own row.
//
// Still NOT here, and absent rather than stubbed: listing, the directory,
// `focus()`, storage, the unread index, per-conversation handles, and more than
// one live conversation at a time. Every field and method below is one this
// slice actually implements; the rest of the surface arrives with the slice
// that can honestly populate it.

 * The observable state of a conversation client.

 * without gaining a single new concept.
 *
 * ── Why this is three fields and not ten ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The design's full shape adds `order`, `index`, `directory`, `listing`,
 * `focusedId` and `listStale`. Every one of them is REST-sourced or
 * runtime-sourced, and this slice has neither REST nor runtimes — they would
 * be permanently `[]`, `{}` and `false`, which is a worse lie than an absent
 * field. They arrive with the slices that fill them. Adding a readable field
 * to a state object consumers only ever read is additive, so this ordering
 * costs nobody a migration.
