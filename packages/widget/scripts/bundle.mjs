// This is a DIFFERENT build from tsup's, with opposite rules, which is why it
// is a separate script rather than a second tsup entry:
//
//   tsup's output is for bundler users. Core, js, and rest stay EXTERNAL, so
//   an app that already imports core carries one copy of it.
//
//   This output is for a `<script src>`. There is no bundler on the other end
//   to resolve an import, so everything is INLINED, and the format is IIFE
//   rather than ESM — a plain `<script>` tag cannot evaluate an ESM bundle,
//   and requiring `type="module"` would drop every browser that still needs
//   the nomodule path and complicate the one-line install the whole package
//   exists to offer.
//
// The gzipped number is the one that matters: every CDN serving this will
// compress it, so the raw byte count overstates the cost by roughly 3x. Both
// are printed so the ratio is visible.

//
// THIS NUMBER MOVED DOWN, from 92,160, and it is the first time it has moved
// in that direction. The reason is that a long-standing cost was RETIRED
// rather than paid: the stylesheet's CSS comments are string data (see the
// plugin above), so no minifier ever removed them and every visitor of every
// host page downloaded 134 blocks of developer prose. Stripping them at build
// time took this artifact from 320,918 B to 264,724 B raw, and from 95,661 B
// to 75,927 B gzip — a 19,734 B saving on the number that is actually
// downloaded. Those are the figures the comparison pass at the bottom of this
// file prints on every build (`19.3 KB gzip (93.4 KB without the strip)`),
// measured the way it measures them: one esbuild pass with the plugin removed
// and nothing else changed. That pass writes no sourcemap, so 35 B of the raw
// difference is an absent `sourceMappingURL` comment rather than prose.
//
// Leaving the ceiling at 92,160 would have left more than 16 KB of silent
// regression room where the old budget only ever allowed 6,263 B. That is not
// a budget, it is a formality, and it would have let the whole saving be
// spent again without anyone being told.
// Increased to 112 KiB (114,688 B) for embedding real Figma agent avatar face photos
