// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// The brand band — the header row, the offline banner and the hero header as
// ONE painted element (`.dh-brand-band`) rather than three that each paint
// their own copy of the merchant's gradient.
//
// ── What this file can and cannot prove ───────────────────────────────────
//
// jsdom computes NO cascade and NO layout. Nothing here can show that the
// gradient is continuous across the seam, that the band paints past the space
// it occupies, or that Home's CTA card straddles the band's bottom edge —
// those are rendered-pixel claims, and NOTHING IN THIS REPO GATES THEM TODAY.
// `packages/widget/scripts/verify-appearance.mjs` is the real-Chrome harness
// that could, but as written it asserts the launcher, the panel, the thread
// backdrop, the avatar and the branding row, and contains no assertion that
// names the band, the straddle or gradient continuity at all. Treat every
// rendered claim below as UNVERIFIED until a browser check exists.
//
// What such a check would have to measure, precisely:
//
//   * ONE PAINT. `getComputedStyle('.dh-brand-band').backgroundImage` is a
//     single gradient, while `.dh-header` and `.dh-hero` both report `none` —
//     that is the seam being gone rather than merely undeclared.
//   * THE OVERHANG. `.dh-brand-band`'s bottom border-edge sits BELOW
//     `.dh-home`'s top edge by the straddle distance, and `.dh-home-cta`'s
//     `getBoundingClientRect().top` is above that border edge.
//   * NET ZERO. `.dh-brand-band.offsetHeight` minus its computed
//     `marginBottom` equals the sum of its three children's `offsetHeight`s,
//     which is the "the two cancel, nothing else moves" claim (D6 on the
//     classic design is the same measurement with the rule not applying).
//   * THE COLLAPSE ARITHMETIC. Record `.dh-hero.offsetHeight` and
//     `.dh-home.getBoundingClientRect().top`, force `data-collapsed="true"`,
//     and assert Home's top rose by exactly the recorded hero height — the
//     claim ui/styles.ts's straddle comment marks as expected-not-measured.
//   * D2 LIVE. With `data-collapsed="true"` set,
//     `getComputedStyle('.dh-brand-band').paddingBottom` is `0px`; with it
//     cleared, it is the straddle distance. `:has()` cannot be evaluated in
//     jsdom (nwsapi throws on it), so this half is only ever browser-checkable.
//
// What jsdom CAN settle is the two things the fix is built out of:
//
//   1. the SHADOW TREE — one wrapper, the right three children, in the right
//      order, and the three ATTRIBUTES the straddle's `:has()` matches on
//      actually being produced by the runtime. Those are real behavioural
//      assertions about what `mount()` builds and what it does next.
//   2. the STYLESHEET TEXT — a STATIC-ASSET check, not a behavioural one.
//      Asserting that `background-image: var(--dh-header-layers)` is declared
//      exactly once, on `.dh-brand-band`, proves the sheet no longer asks two
//      elements to paint the same gradient twice. It does NOT prove what any
//      pixel ended up being. Every assertion in `the brand paint, as written
//      in the stylesheet` below is of that second kind and is labelled again
//      where it sits.

 * emitted as though it were top-level, with its condition thrown away. This
 * sheet has several (`prefers-color-scheme`, `prefers-reduced-motion`,
 * `pointer: fine`, `hover: none`, `@keyframes dh-bounce`). So `bodyOf` and
 * `selectorsDeclaring` answer "is this declared ANYWHERE in the file",
 * never "is this declared unconditionally" — and a selector that appears both
 * at top level and inside a media query would make `bodyOf` throw on its own
 * uniqueness check rather than pick one. Nothing the band needs is inside an
 * at-rule today; a check that grows to need at-rule awareness should reach for
