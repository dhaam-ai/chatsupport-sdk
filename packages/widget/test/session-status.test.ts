// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// Defect 4, client half: EVERY conversation shows a status, on BOTH lists, out
// of ONE mapping.
//
// What was wrong. `ui/home-screen.ts` carried a private three-entry table
// (RESOLVED / CLOSED / WAITING_FOR_AGENT) and rendered an empty, hidden pill
// for OPEN, ASSIGNED and ON_HOLD — so the recent conversation a customer was
// most likely still in the middle of was the one row that said nothing about
// where it stood. The Messages list named all six, from a second table living
// in `ui/session-picker.ts`. Two tables, one of them incomplete, is how that
// happens, so the words now live once in `ui/session-status.ts` and this file
// holds both screens to it.
//
// Component-level rather than through a mounted widget on purpose: this is
// about the mapping being TOTAL and SHARED, which is a property of the two
// render functions and not of any particular session's journey.

// ── D4: Home shows "Recent conversation" only for an OPEN one ─────────────
//
// The user's decision, in answer to a direct question and in their own words:
// "in home only open recent conversation if not then display none."
//
// They were shown a broader option — hide only RESOLVED and CLOSED, keeping
// the three live-but-not-open states — and chose the narrow one. WAITING,
// ASSIGNED and ON_HOLD are hidden here on purpose, not by oversight, so this
// is asserted status by status rather than as "not resolved and not closed":
// a future edit that widens it fails loudly instead of quietly being kinder.
//
// Nothing THIS decision hides becomes unreachable. A conversation in any of
// the four statuses it hides and still lists — RESOLVED, WAITING_FOR_AGENT,
// ASSIGNED, ON_HOLD — is on the Messages screen, reached from the bottom tab
// bar that is on screen whenever Home is; this section is a shortcut back
// into the one conversation still going, not the list. NOT via Home's "See
// all": that button is a child of the section this hides, so it goes when the
// section goes. The Messages tab is the whole surviving route.
//
// CLOSED is the exception, and it is NOT this decision's doing. As of
// 2026-09-14 widget.ts withholds closed conversations from the customer's
// surfaces upstream of both screens (`customerVisibleSessions`), so a CLOSED
// conversation is on neither Home nor Messages and has no surviving customer
// route at all — deliberately, by a separate user decision. D4 above is
// unchanged and still reads as written; what changed is that it can no longer
// be cited as a guarantee that every status remains reachable. It guarantees
// that for the four statuses above and for no others. The SUPERSEDED block
// further down this file records the other half of the same 2026-09-14 rule
// (which conversation Home is HANDED); the two are one record, and neither
// restores the old blanket guarantee.
//
// The pill's WORDS are still computed for every status (the loop above), so
// the section is hidden with correct content inside it rather than emptied.
// That keeps this a visibility decision, and keeps the vocabulary total.

  // ── SUPERSEDED 2026-09-14: read this before citing the test below ───────
  //
  // This comment used to say that `widget.ts`'s `mostRecentSession` picks the
  // newest session OVERALL, so a visitor whose newest conversation had just
  // been closed saw no Recent section even when an older OPEN one existed,
  // and that this was approved as-is. That is no longer the rule. Asked
  // directly, the user decided that "don't show closed sessions" extends to
  // Home too: CLOSED is now filtered out of the customer's conversations
  // before Home is handed anything (`customerVisibleSessions` in widget.ts),
  // so `mostRecentSession` skips closed ones and Home offers the most recent
  // NON-closed conversation instead of nothing.
  //
  // What that leaves unchanged, and what this test still guards: Home's own
  // status rule. `SHOWN_IN_RECENT` is untouched — the section still appears
  // for OPEN and for nothing else, so RESOLVED, WAITING_FOR_AGENT, ASSIGNED
  // and ON_HOLD still hide it, per the separate and still-valid D4 decision
  // above. The two rules compose: one decides WHICH conversation Home is
  // handed, this one decides whether it is shown.
  //
  // What this test does NOT cover, and must not be read as evidence about:
  // it calls `home.update()` directly with a CLOSED summary and never
  // exercises `mostRecentSession`, so it proves only that Home hides the
  // section for a CLOSED conversation it is handed — not that widget.ts
  // would ever hand it one. Under the new rule it would not, except for the
  // conversation the customer is currently in. The selection rule is proven
  // where it lives, in test/closed-session-hidden.test.ts ("skips a closed
  // newest conversation and offers the open one behind it").
