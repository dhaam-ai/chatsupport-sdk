// The anonymous web-form submit client — POST /widget/webform.
//
// A DEDICATED client, not `RestClient` (`packages/rest`), and that is
// deliberate: `RestClient.request` awaits `#getAccessToken()` and sends
// `Authorization: Bearer` on every call, but this route takes only
// `X-Publishable-Key` and never mints a token (see
// `docs/design/chat-service-webform-endpoint.md` D3 and
// `docs/design/DECISIONS.md` D3) — the tenant comes from the key alone.
// Routing an anonymous submit through `RestClient` would make it fail
// whenever the token mint fails, which is exactly the outage during which a
// visitor most wants to leave a message.
//
// Shaped like `remote-config.ts`'s fetch half instead: its own `fetch`, its
// own `AbortController`, and a contract that resolves with exactly one shape
// or rejects with exactly one shape.
//
// ── The server's `message` is never shown ────────────────────────────────

// An error body is attacker-influencable and may echo request detail —
// `packages/rest/src/client.ts` states the same rule for the same reason.
// The visitor's sentence comes from {@link visitorMessage}, which reads only
// `error.kind`; the raw error (with its `code` and `requestId`) goes to
// `config.onError`.
