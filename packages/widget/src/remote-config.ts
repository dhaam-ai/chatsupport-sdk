// The published widget configuration, fetched from chat-service.
//
// Until now this package was 100% local: every knob came from a `data-*`
// attribute or a `mount()` argument, and the only `fetch()` in it was the token
// mint. That made the console's "Save" button a lie — a merchant could edit
// their greeting, their pre-chat fields, their offline message, and nothing
// downstream ever read them.
//
// ── Precedence: HOST > REMOTE > built-in default ─────────────────────────
//
// A value the host page stated explicitly always wins. Remote config fills in
// only what the host left unsaid, and the built-in defaults fill what is left.
//
// This is deliberately the OPPOSITE of the React widget, where a successful
// fetch clobbers every field of the props (ChatWidget.tsx merges
// `{ ...config, ...published }`). That direction is wrong for an embedded
// script tag. A host that hardcoded `data-accent="#0f172a"` to match its
// checkout page has made a statement about ITS OWN page that a merchant
// clicking Save in a console tab cannot see and should not be able to
// overrule mid-session. Inverting it also makes the failure mode benign:
// when the fetch fails the widget renders exactly what the host asked for,
// rather than snapping between two different appearances depending on
// whether a network call landed.
//
// The consequence to keep in mind: a field the host sets is permanently
// un-remote-configurable for that host. That is the intended trade — it is
// the host's page.
//
// ── What is NOT read from here ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `auth`, `identity`, `apiUrl`, `wsUrl`, `sessionId`, `getToken`, `onError`.
// Credentials and endpoints are the host's to state and are needed BEFORE
// this call can be made at all. There is no `secretKey` field on the
// response type and no field that could carry one, for the same reason
// config.ts has none: a shape with no slot for a credential cannot leak one.
