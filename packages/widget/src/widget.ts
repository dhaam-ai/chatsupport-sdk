/**
 * The states in which core is still working on the connection by itself.
 *
 * ── Why "Reconnect" is inert here, and does not force an attempt ──────────
 *
 * The bug this set exists to fix was that `connecting` belonged to NEITHER
 * list: the Reconnect button and the `online` listener were both gated on
 * `TERMINAL_CONNECTION_STATES`, so in the one state a client actually parks in
 * when the server is down, both silently did nothing and the customer got an
 * indefinite "Connecting…" with no further signal.
 *
 * The answer is not to let them call `connect()` here. Two independent reasons,
 * both readable in core's connection/controller.ts:
 *
 *   1. It cannot work. `connect()` returns the in-flight promise whenever one
 *      is pending, and that promise settles only on `connection.ack`,
 *      `disconnect()`, or `#suspend` — never on a retryable close. In exactly
 *      the reported scenario (server unreachable from the first load) it stays
 *      pending for the whole retry loop, so every `connect()` returns the same
 *      promise and opens no socket. A button wired to it would be a no-op by
 *      construction; enabling it only makes the no-op loud.
 *
 *   2. Where it could work, it would compete. After a successful connect and a
 *      later drop the promise is settled, so `connect()` runs `#cancelTimers()`
 *      and resets `#attempt` to 0 — cancelling core's armed backoff timer AND
 *      restarting its exponential backoff from the bottom. A customer tapping
 *      the button would pin backoff at attempt 0 for as long as they kept
 *      tapping. That is the second, competing retry mechanism this widget must
 *      not become.
 *
 * Core also no longer needs the help: every attempt now produces a close
 * within `connectTimeoutMs` (10s by default) and routes into the existing
 * backoff, so `connecting` self-heals unaided. What was missing was never the
 * button — it was the SIGNAL. So the control becomes visible-but-disabled once
 * something has demonstrably gone wrong, the status line says which thing, and
 * the button becomes pressable the instant core actually parks.

   *
   *   - Core epoch-stamps in-flight loads and abandons superseded ones, so
   *     an overlapping seed no longer corrupts a switch. This wait went from
   *     the correctness barrier it was written as to an optimisation that
   *     saves a duplicate fetch — and an optimisation must not be able to
   *     veto the operation it is optimising.
   *   - Proceeding is what produces the customer-visible answer. On a dead
   *     socket `switchSession` fails immediately and audibly — core's
   *     `joinSessionAwaited` answers `disconnected` with "session.join was not
   *     sent: the socket is not open" — and `selectSession` reports it. On a

   *
   * Goes through the real endpoint, not a client-side re-enable:
   * `store.client.reopenSession` is core's `ChatClient.reopenSession`, backed
   * by `POST /chat/sessions/{id}/reopen` (`@dhaam-ccrm/rest`'s adapter) — the
   * same customer-facing action the React/Vue/Angular bindings already
   * expose and this widget alone was missing. Faking it locally (just
   * flipping the composer back on) would leave the server still holding the
   * session CLOSED, so a reload — or any other client watching the same
   * session — would show it terminated again while this tab disagreed.
   *
   * No busy latch of its own, unlike `endConversation` above: the button that
   * calls this owns its own busy/error state via `submitOnce`
   * (`ui/ended-footer.ts`), which is also why this rejects rather than
   * catching — a swallowed rejection here would leave that button unable to
   * tell the difference between "worked" and "failed silently".
   *
   * Nothing else has to be re-synced on success. `reopenSession` commits the
   * resolved session through the same `commitSession` path `closeSession`
   * uses (core's `create-chat-client.ts`), and the `state.session` id/status
   * subscription already wired above (`syncProductSurfaces`) reacts to that
   * commit and repaints the panel — the identical reactive path that already
   * puts the composer back once a CSAT rating is submitted.

   * A Common Questions row was tapped (`ui/common-questions.ts`).
   *
   * ── The real bug this replaces ────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The previous wiring called `store.client.sendMessage(question.prompt)`
   * directly. Common Questions render only while `ui/common-questions.ts`'s
   * own precondition holds — "before a conversation exists" — which means
   * `state.session` is `null` exactly when a customer can see a row to tap.
   * Core's `MessageController.sendMessage` throws `NoActiveSessionError` with
   * no session joined (see `packages/core/src/messages/controller.ts`), so
   * that call REJECTED on essentially every real tap, and `.catch(report)`
   * routed the failure straight to the console. Nothing the customer did was
   * wrong and nothing was visibly broken — the send simply never reached the
   * wire, which is indistinguishable from "tapping does nothing" from where
   * they were sitting. Confirmed live: a tap threw `NoActiveSessionError`
   * every time in the running widget.
   *
   * The fix mints a session first, exactly like `startNewConversation`
   * above — no topic/subject pair here, because a tapped question already
   * IS the subject — puts the resulting conversation on screen via
   * `showConversation` (the same call `selectSession` uses) the moment the
   * session exists, and only then sends the prompt as its opening line. The
   * navigation is the second half of the report: even a send that HAD
   * succeeded left the customer looking at whichever screen they tapped
   * from, with no visible sign anything happened. Navigating BEFORE the send
   * rather than after is what removes the blink: the transcript is on screen
   * for the send's round trip instead of Home, and `openingLinesInFlight`
   * keeps the pre-chat gate from filling that empty transcript first.
   *
   * ── Deliberately no pre-chat fields on this route ─────────────────────
   *
   * A Common Question is the merchant offering a direct route into a chat —
   * one tap, and the customer is talking. Putting the "ask for details
   * first" form between the tap and the conversation would turn the shortcut
   * back into the long way round, so this path skips the fields entirely
   * (and leaves `preChatAnswered` alone: the customer was never asked, so a
   * later new-conversation form still asks). The merchant who wants details
   * from everyone still gets them from every other entry point.
