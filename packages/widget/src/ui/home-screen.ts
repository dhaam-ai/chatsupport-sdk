/**
 * Which statuses Home's "Recent conversation" section shows at all.
 *
 * `OPEN` and nothing else, decided by the product owner in answer to a direct
 * question: this section is a shortcut back into the conversation still
 * going, not a second conversation list. A row that is `RESOLVED` or `CLOSED`
 * is over; `WAITING_FOR_AGENT`, `ASSIGNED` and `ON_HOLD` are live but are
 * waiting on the merchant rather than on the customer, and putting either
 * kind at the top of Home invites a tap that leads somewhere the customer has
 * nothing left to do. A narrower rule than "hide the finished ones" was
 * offered alongside the broader one and this is the one that was chosen — so
 * widening it is a product decision, not a tidy-up.
 *
 * Nothing this table hides becomes unreachable: a conversation in any of the
 * four statuses it hides and still lists — `RESOLVED`, `WAITING_FOR_AGENT`,
 * `ASSIGNED`, `ON_HOLD` — is still on the Messages screen, and the bottom tab
 * bar that opens it is on screen whenever Home is. Not behind this section's
 * own "See all" — that button is a CHILD of the section (`recentSection`
 * below), so hiding the section takes "See all" with it. The Messages tab is
 * the whole surviving route, which is why it has to be one that is always
 * there.
 *
 * That reachability argument NARROWED on 2026-09-14, and only for `CLOSED`.
 * It used to read "every conversation in every status is still on the
 * Messages screen"; that is no longer true. `widget.ts` now withholds closed
 * conversations from the customer's surfaces upstream of this screen (see
 * `customerVisibleSessions` there), so a `CLOSED` conversation is on neither
 * Home nor Messages and has no surviving customer route at all — deliberately,
 * by user decision: closed is the merchant taking it off the table, and a
 * route back into something the customer can do nothing with is a dead end.
 * `RESOLVED`, `WAITING_FOR_AGENT`, `ASSIGNED` and `ON_HOLD` are unaffected and
 * the paragraph above holds for them in full, which is what matters when
 * weighing this table: hiding a status HERE still costs nothing but a tap for
 * every status except `CLOSED`, which is already withheld upstream — except
 * for the joined-session case, which is the one way a `CLOSED` summary still
 * reaches `update()` at all (see the `@param recent` note below).
 *
 * A `Record<ChatStatus, boolean>` rather than `status === 'OPEN'`, for exactly
 * the reason `ui/session-status.ts` gives for its own table: a seventh wire
 * status has to be a COMPILE ERROR here. `!== 'OPEN'` would silently keep a
 * new status hidden, which is the safe half; `=== 'OPEN'` written the other
 * way round would silently show it. Neither would make anyone decide.

   * @param recent the newest of the conversations the customer still has

   *   the whole "Recent conversation" section is conditional rather than an
   *   empty-state box. The other part is its STATUS: the section shows only
   *   for an `OPEN` one (see {@link SHOWN_IN_RECENT}), so passing a resolved
   *   or waiting conversation here renders the row and hides the section.
   *
   *   Which conversation that is remains the caller's choice, not this
   *   screen's, and that choice CHANGED on 2026-09-14 by explicit user
   *   decision. It used to be the newest session overall, so a visitor whose
   *   newest conversation had just been closed saw no Recent section even
   *   when an older open one existed; that is superseded. `widget.ts` now
   *   filters `CLOSED` out of the customer's conversations
   *   (`customerVisibleSessions`) before this screen is handed anything, so
   *   `mostRecentSession` skips closed ones and a closed conversation no
   *   longer stands in front of an open one here.
   *
   *   With one exception, which is why this can still be handed a `CLOSED`
   *   summary: the conversation the customer is currently JOINED to is exempt
   *   from that filter (so it cannot vanish from under them mid-read — see
   *   `customerVisibleSessions`), and while it is both closed and newest it
   *   still wins `mostRecentSession` and hides this section even when an
   *   older OPEN conversation exists.
   *
   *   Only `CLOSED`. `mostRecentSession` is still not "the newest OPEN one":
   *   a visitor whose newest conversation has just been RESOLVED still sees
   *   no Recent section even when an older open one exists, because
   *   {@link SHOWN_IN_RECENT} — a separate, still-valid decision — shows the
   *   section for `OPEN` and nothing else. The older one is one tap away on
   *   Messages.
   * @param entry the resolved support entry — which of the six PRD rows this
   *   render is for. Drives the CTA's title/sub-line, the alt button beside
   *   it, and the mid-visit chat→ticket announcement.
