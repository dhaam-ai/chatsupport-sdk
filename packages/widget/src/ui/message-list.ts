 * to a human, `handledBy` names the AGENT, and the bot's earlier messages —
 * still in the transcript, right above the agent's — would fall back to the
 * generic word. The name is remembered per session (cleared when the session
 * id changes, see `render`) rather than re-derived, because nothing else on
 * the wire still carries it at that point.
 *

 * agent: on a session the customer has just joined from history, `participants`
 * may be empty (everyone has left) while `handledBy` still names who had it.
