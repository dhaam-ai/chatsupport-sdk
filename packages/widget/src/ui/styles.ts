// Every style this widget has, as one string injected into the shadow root.
//
// ── Font inheritance, which is the opposite of the usual claim ───────────
//
// It is widely repeated that a shadow root "does not inherit fonts". That is
// not what the cascade does. INHERITED properties — `font-family`, `font-size`,
// `line-height`, `color`, `letter-spacing`, `direction` — cross the shadow
// boundary perfectly well, because the shadow tree's root inherits from its
// HOST element, and the host element is an ordinary node in the light DOM
// inheriting from the page. What does NOT cross is anything that requires a
// SELECTOR to match: `body { font-family: X }` reaches us (through
// inheritance), while `.chat p { font-family: X }` never does.
//
// So the real hazard is the reverse of the folklore: left alone we silently
// adopt the host's typography, including a 20px base size from a marketing
// site, a display face with no lowercase, or a webfont that has not loaded and
// renders as invisible text. `:host` therefore sets the inherited properties
// explicitly — that is what actually isolates them.
//
// `font: inherit` is offered as `WidgetConfig.font: 'inherit'` for hosts that
// want brand continuity, which is a legitimate thing to want and is why this
// is a setting rather than a hardcode. `all: initial` on `:host` was rejected:
// it would also reset the custom properties the theme is built from, and it
// resets `direction`, which would break every RTL host.
//
// ── Stacking ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The shadow root solves style leakage in both directions. It does NOT solve
// stacking: a shadow host is an ordinary element in the host's z-order, so v1's
// `z-index: 999999` still loses to any host that bids higher. See ui/root.ts —
// the container is promoted to the TOP LAYER via the popover API where that
// exists, which no z-index can outrank, and falls back to the real maximum
// (2147483647) rather than v1's arbitrary six digits.

/* ── The offline banner ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Directly under the header row and painted as its own band, because it is a
   statement about the whole panel rather than about any one screen: it stays
   put while the customer moves between Home, Messages and a conversation, and
   'flex: none' keeps it out of the space the transcript scrolls in.

   Amber, not red — see ui/offline-banner.ts. Nothing has failed; every message
   is held and the connection is retrying. The two tones differ only in how
   warm they are: 'offline' is the customer's own network and reads as
   information, 'unreachable' is our service and is a shade more insistent.

   The two colour pairs are palette TOKENS ('--dh-warn-*', '--dh-alarm-*') so
   they follow the same three-way light/dark/pinned switch as everything else,
   but they are deliberately NOT derived from the merchant's accent the way the
   header and bubbles are. A status band tinted with the brand colour goes
   invisible on the merchant whose brand IS amber, and this is the one surface
   whose whole job is to be noticed.

   'position: sticky' with 'top: 0' costs nothing where the banner is already
   in flow, and holds it in place if a future layout ever scrolls the column
   it sits in. That column is now '.dh-brand-band' (widget.ts), not
   '.dh-panel' — the band became this banner's sticky containing block when it
   became its parent — so the intent is scoped accordingly: inert today,
   because neither box scrolls, and it would come alive only for a layout that
   made the BAND itself a scroll container. Nothing about the banner's
   position under the header row, or about its live region, changed with it.

/* ── The hero header ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Gated on 'data-design="hero"', and that gate is the whole reason the
   default is 'classic'. Painting the header in the brand colour is a
   redesign, and it must reach only the merchants who asked for one in the
   console — never a host who embedded a script tag and never opened it.

   The background is two layers: a flat colour, and a gradient or image over
   it ('--dh-header-layers', 'none' when neither applies). The foreground is
   computed from the colour's luminance rather than hardcoded white, because
   a pastel brand with white text is a header nobody can read.

   ── One paint, on the BAND, not two on its parts ────────────────────────

   This used to be declared twice: here, and again on '.dh-hero' below, each
   with its own 'background-size: cover'. Both are honest readings of "paint
   this brand colour", and together they are a bug you can see:
   '--dh-header-layers' is a 'linear-gradient(180deg, …)' top-to-bottom fade,
   and 'cover' sizes it to the BOX it is painted on, so the fade ran out over
   the header row's own height and then STARTED OVER at the top of the hero.
   Two distinct bands with a hard edge between them, on a surface whose whole
   purpose is to read as one tall header. A background image had the same
   fault in a louder form — the merchant's photo, cropped twice, at two
   different scales.

   So it is painted ONCE, on '.dh-brand-band' (widget.ts), the element that
   contains all three parts; the parts themselves paint nothing and inherit
   '--dh-header-fg' from it. There is no seam left to restart at.

   'background-size: cover' survives the move, and moving it up here did not
   retire what 'cover' costs on a box whose height changes — it relocated and
   widened it. That is a KNOWN, accepted consequence, written out under
   '.dh-hero' below; read it before reaching for a different 'background-size'
   here. */

/* The hero's content block. It paints NOTHING of its own: the brand colour,

   the box that spans the header row, the offline banner and this — see that
   rule for why one paint on the parent is not the same thing as the same
   paint on each child.

   'flex: none' for the same reason .dh-composer has it: the transcript is the
   only element in the panel column allowed to absorb spare height. The hero
   only ever renders while that transcript is EMPTY (see widget.ts), so what
   it takes costs nothing that was being used.

   Collapsed means GONE, not shorter: '[data-collapsed="true"]' snaps the
   band to zero height (the product owner rejected the earlier 66px compact
   bar — an empty dead strip on tenants with no logo/faces — see
   ui/hero-header.ts's module header). A HEIGHT snap, not an animation, is
   what actually gives that space back to '.dh-home'; 'overflow: hidden' is
   what keeps the still-present '.dh-hero-full' content from painting out of
   a zero-height box while it fades. Nothing else is needed — at height 0 this
   box adds no height to '.dh-brand-band', so the brand paint simply ends under the
   header row, exactly as it does on a screen that never had a hero.

   ── The re-stretched gradient: RELOCATED and widened, not retired ────────

   The 66px compact bar needed a 'background-image: none' carve-out because a
   painted box whose height changes re-stretches the gradient painted on it.
   It is tempting to read the rules above as having killed that regression,
   and this comment used to say so. It has not. This element has no background
   left to stretch, but '.dh-brand-band' has one, and 'background-size: cover'
   sizes it to the BAND's box — so the fault moved up one level, and up there
   it has MORE ways to fire than the 66px bar ever gave it. Every change to
   the band's height re-scales the merchant's gradient (or re-crops their
   background image). There are three:

     1. this hero collapsing to 0 and expanding back — the rules below, on
        every scroll away from the top of Home and back;
     2. the offline banner appearing and disappearing — widget.ts stacks it
        inside this same band, so losing signal re-scales the brand paint;
     3. leaving Home for Messages or a conversation — 'setPaneVisible' hides
        this hero outright and the band shrinks to the header row.

   None of that is fixed here, and none of it should be. It is the accepted
   price of painting the header row and the hero as ONE box (D1): a single
   band that re-scales when its height changes beats two permanently
   mismatched bands that never do. Anyone who wants it gone is not tuning
   'background-size' — they are reopening D1. */

/* ── The straddle: Home's first card sits ON the band's bottom edge ───────

   Home's primary call to action ('.dh-home-cta', ui/home-screen.ts) sat
   entirely below the brand paint, which read as the first row of a list
   rather than as the one thing the screen is asking for. It now overlaps the
   band's bottom edge — roughly its top half over the brand colour, its bottom
   half over the panel's own surface.

   The mechanism is: grow the painted box, then take the same distance back
   off its outer edge. 'padding-bottom' extends the paint past where the band
   ends, and the equal, opposite 'margin-bottom' pulls '.dh-home' — the very
   next sibling, see widget.ts — back up by exactly as much. The two cancel,
   so the panel's total layout is IDENTICAL to what it was before this rule
   existed; the only difference is a strip of brand paint behind the top of
   Home's first card.

   ── Why that distance ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   It IS a step on the spacing scale — 'calc(var(--dh-space) * 12)', and this
   sheet already steps in '* 3', '* 4', '* 5' and '* 6' off the same 4px
   token. Written against the token rather than as a bare '48px' so it cannot
   silently stop being a step the day '--dh-space' moves.

   Twelve steps because that is '.dh-home's own 16px of top padding (4 steps)
   plus 32px (8) of the card below it — roughly HALF the card, which is the
   honest framing; there is no exact card height to be half of. '.dh-home-cta'
   is 'align-items: center', so its height is whichever is taller of the 36px
   icon and the text column, plus 12px padding twice and 1px border twice.
   With no sub-line the icon wins and the card is 62px. With one, the text
   column wins — a 14px title and a 12px sub-line at the panel's 1.45
   line-height, 2px apart, so about 40px — and the card is about 66px. Half is
   therefore 31–33px depending on what the merchant configured, which is why
   the value is a rounded 32 and the description is "roughly half".

   (That arithmetic is read off the declarations in this file, not measured in
   a browser. It decides only how much of the card the strip covers, so being
   a pixel or two out is a cosmetic difference, not a layout one.)

   Named once and used twice, because the two uses must stay EQUAL — the day
   they drift is the day the panel's whole layout shifts by the difference,
   which is not a bug anyone would look for in a padding value.

   No 'z-index', and none is needed: '.dh-home' is a LATER sibling than the
   band, so ordinary in-flow paint order already puts the card (and Home's
   whole subtree) above the brand paint. The overhanging strip does not steal
   clicks or scrolls from Home for the same reason — hit-testing follows paint
   order. Adding a z-index here would be actively wrong, for the reason stated
   in full on '.dh-brand-band' in the header section.

   The ':has()' is what keeps the overhang honest, and each ':not()' in it
   mirrors one of the two rules directly above: a collapsed hero (height 0) or
   one that is hidden/empty (display: none) takes the hero out of the layout,
   and the overhang has to leave with it. Without them the band would go on
   overhanging Home by the straddle distance with no hero under it — the card
   would ride up over the HEADER ROW the moment a scroll collapsed the hero,
   and on Messages and in a conversation, where there is no hero at all
   either. ':has()' is live: it
   is re-evaluated on the same frame 'data-collapsed' flips, which is the
   frame the height snaps on.

   Both halves living HERE, on the band, is also what keeps ui/hero-header.ts's
   collapse guard honest. That guard refuses to collapse unless the container
   will still be scrolled past its slack once the hero's height comes back, and
   it measures that height as the hero's own 'offsetHeight'. Because the
   padding and the margin below cancel — and leave together — a collapse is
   EXPECTED to return exactly the hero's height to '.dh-home' and not a pixel
   more. Expected, not measured: that follows from the two declarations below
   being equal and opposite, and nothing in this repo has yet watched it
   happen (see test/brand-band.test.ts's header for what a browser check would
   have to measure). Move either declaration onto '.dh-hero' itself and it
   stops being true even in principle: the guard would then over-count the
   freed space by the straddle distance and re-open the oscillation loop that
   guard exists to close.

   ── A known artifact, accepted, deliberately NOT fixed ───────────────────

   Precondition: the collapse guard refuses while 'overflow - freed <= 32px'.
   Inside that window a visitor can scroll '.dh-home' with the hero still
   expanded and this strip still in place, which slides Home's own content up
   underneath the brand paint. Home's later children have transparent
   backgrounds — '.dh-home-section-title' and '.dh-entry-note' are muted grey
   text on nothing — so for the length of that scroll they can pass over the
   merchant's brand colour and lose their contrast against it.

   Accepted as-is. The obvious repair, a background on '.dh-home', would paint
   over the band and destroy the straddle outright — the straddle works only
   because Home's surface is transparent where it overlaps. The window is
   narrow (a Home short enough that the guard refuses, yet long enough to
   scroll), the effect is transient and affects decoration rather than any
   control's label. Anything better than accepting it is a redesign of this
   rule, not a tweak to it. */

/* ── Messages screen (ui/messages-screen.ts) ──────────────────────────────

   Row styling deliberately mirrors .dh-session-row rather than sharing its
   selector — see messages-screen.ts's own header on why this is a fresh
   component rather than session-picker.ts's row factory reused, and why
   duplicating a few small rules here is the safer trade against editing an
   already-shipped block those tests already pin.

   ── Why the scroll boundary is NOT here any more ─────────────────────────

   This element used to carry 'overflow-y: auto' directly, with the search
   box, the row list AND the "New conversation" button all as its normal-flow
   children. That made the button "flex: none" — which stops it from being
   squished, and nothing else — but it was still an ordinary child of the one
   box that scrolled, so it scrolled away with the rows exactly like every
   row above it. Confirmed live: scrolling the row list carried the button
   off the bottom of the panel with it, which is the reported bug ("has to
   scroll to find it").
   'flex: none' only ever meant "don't grow or shrink"; it was never a
   pinning declaration, and nothing else in this rule made it one.

   The fix moves the scrollable region down one level, onto
   '.dh-messages-list' alone (below) — search and the button stay here, in
   this NON-scrolling flex column, so they never move regardless of how long
   the row list gets. This element keeps 'flex: 1; min-height: 0' because it
   is still the one child of '.dh-panel's screen column allowed to grow into
   the space Home/the transcript would otherwise use — see '.dh-home's
   identical pair, just above, for the same contract with the SAME ancestor. */
