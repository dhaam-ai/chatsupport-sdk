// Who the customer is talking to, in the panel header.
//
// ── The two semantics this file exists to get right ──────────────────────
//
// `ChatSession.handledBy` (core, state/types.ts) carries exactly one bit of
// presentation information, and getting either half of it wrong tells the
// customer something false:
//
//   1. ABSENT means "render your own configured title" — never "nobody is
//      handling this chat". `status`/`mode` carry that signal, not this
//      field. An absent `handledBy` must never blank the header, spin it, or
//      say "no agent".
//
//   2. PRESENT does not always mean CURRENT. A session reactivated from
//      CLOSED/RESOLVED keeps its previous agent server-side, so `handledBy`
//      can still name someone while `status` is back to
//      `WAITING_FOR_AGENT` — that person is not actually on the chat right
//      now. Core's `isHandledByCurrent` (client/session.ts, T10) is the one
//      canonical gate for this, "same spirit as `deriveTickState`" per its
//      own doc — every binding calls it rather than re-deriving the
//      WAITING_FOR_AGENT special case locally. Both rules collapse into one
//      call: `isHandledByCurrent` already returns `false` for an absent
//      `handledBy` (its first conjunct), so gating the whole label on it
//      handles rule 1 and rule 2 with a single branch — there is no second,
//      separate "is it absent" check to keep in sync with it.
//
// `HandledBy`/`ChatStatus` are imported straight from `@dhaam-ccrm/core`
// rather than `@dhaam-ccrm/js`, matching message-list.ts's existing
// AttachmentMetadata/CloseReason workaround: the binding package re-exports
// most of ChatState's shape but not every type reachable from it, and a
// type-only import costs nothing at runtime.
