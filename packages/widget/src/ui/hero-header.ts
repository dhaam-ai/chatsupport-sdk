// The tall branded header — the console's `design: 'hero'`.
//
// ── What "hero" means HERE, which is not quite what it means in the console ─
//
// In `chatsupport_react` the hero is a HOME SCREEN: a tall panel with a
// greeting and a "send us a message" card, and picking that card is what opens
// a conversation. It collapses once the visitor scrolls into one.
//
// This widget NOW has that home/conversation split (`ui/screens.ts`,
// `ui/home-screen.ts`), and the hero is mounted as the Home screen's own
// banner — `widget.ts` shows it exactly while `screens.current() === 'home'`
// and `design === 'hero'`. Before that wiring landed, this widget's panel WAS
// the conversation, and the hero stood in for a home screen by keying off
// "the transcript is EMPTY" instead; that is no longer how any of it works,
// but it is worth naming here because the trigger below reads similarly and
// is a different thing:  `.dh-hero[data-empty="true"]` — "this hero has
// nothing to draw" — is unrelated to which SCREEN is showing.
//
// ── The hero has no call to action, and this is decided ───────────────────
//
// It used to build a `.dh-hero-cta` from `header.ctaEnabled`/`ctaTitle`/
// `ctaSubtitle`, calling back into the same "open the new-conversation
// surface" flow that Home's own card and the Messages screen's "New
// conversation" button open. This file used to describe that overlap as an
// open console/design question. It is not open any more: the answer is that
// the hero renders no CTA at all.
//
// What settled it is that the overlap is not conditional. The hero shows only
// while the Home screen is showing — `widget.ts`'s `syncScreens` gates it on
// `onHome && design === 'hero'`, a strict subset of the times Home is up — and
// `ui/home-screen.ts` builds `.dh-home-cta` on Home unconditionally, so an
// enabled hero CTA is never an alternative to Home's card, it is always a
// SECOND card, directly above it, making the identical offer and leading to
// the identical destination. Two of them is one more than the screen is
// asking for, and the hero's was the weaker of the two: it is inside this
// block's `aria-hidden`, so it carried `tabindex="-1"`, and `ui/focus.ts`'s
// `isHidden` walks up to that same `aria-hidden` and kept it out of the focus
// trap as well. No keyboard user and no screen reader could reach it.
//
// It was still PAINTED and still clickable, so a sighted pointer user does
// lose an affordance here — that is the honest cost and it is not nothing.
// What no user loses is a DESTINATION: Home's own card sits one gap below,
// makes the identical offer and opens the identical flow.
//
// And the removal is a REPAIR, not only a tidy-up. A control the widget drew,
// styled as a button and invited a click on, that keyboard and screen-reader
// users could not operate at all, is a defect on its own terms — it had been
// shipping as one. Deleting it closes that, and leaves one affordance on Home
// which every user can actually reach.
//
// The three console fields still parse and still round-trip (`src/config.ts`,
// `src/remote-config.ts` — they are the published wire schema). They simply
// no longer reach a rendered button; see `heroContentFrom` at the bottom of
// this file for what a merchant who set them sees instead.
//
// ── The collapse: expanded or gone, nothing in between ─────────────────────
//
// The first cut of this feature kept an Intercom-style 66px compact bar
// (logo + faces) pinned behind the tall hero. The product owner rejected it
// against a live tenant — on a hero with no logo and no faces the bar is an
// EMPTY 66px strip of dead colour covering content — and re-specced the
// behaviour: scrolled away from the top, the hero must occupy NO space at
// all, so "Recent conversation"/"Common Questions" slide up directly under
// the panel's standard header row; scrolled back to the top, it returns.
// There is no compact layer any more. One state machine: expanded, or gone.
//
// `.dh-hero` is a `flex: none` band ABOVE `ui/home-screen.ts`'s own scroll
// container (`.dh-home`, `overflow-y: auto`) — nothing about the hero itself
// ever scrolls, so "gone" is a straight `height: 0; overflow: hidden` snap on
// `[data-collapsed="true"]` (ui/styles.ts). Snapping the height rather than
// animating it is what actually returns the freed space to `.dh-home` (a
// `flex: none` sibling shrinking is the only way its `flex: 1` neighbour gets
// more room) without a second, competing animation. The content's own 180ms
// opacity fade (`.dh-hero-full` in ui/styles.ts) is the only thing that
// animates, and it matters on the way BACK: the band's height returns in one
// frame and the content fades in over it instead of popping. A snap is not
// motion in the vestibular sense a slide or a transform is, so it gets no
// `prefers-reduced-motion` carve-out — same stance as `.dh-msg-reply`.
//
// ── The trigger: a zero-space marker at the top of `.dh-home` ──────────────
//
// `watchScroll(scrollHost)` is how `widget.ts` tells this component where
// "the top of Home's content" actually is — `ui/home-screen.ts` owns
// `.dh-home`'s markup and this file has no reason to reach past that
// boundary, so rather than have `home-screen.ts` grow a bespoke sentinel slot
// for one caller, this inserts its own marker into the element it is handed,
// the same "caller supplies the mount point, callee owns what goes in it"
// shape `widget.ts` already uses for `homeQuestionsSlot`.
//
// The marker (`.dh-hero-sentinel`) is `position: absolute; height: 1px`, not
// a normal flow child — `.dh-home` lays its children out with `gap`, and gap
// applies to every flex item regardless of that item's own margins, so a real
// flow child would permanently widen the space above the CTA card by one
// gap's worth for a pixel nobody is meant to see. Absolute costs nothing.
//
// An `IntersectionObserver` rooted at `scrollHost` watching that marker is
// simpler and cheaper than a `scroll` listener doing the same arithmetic on
// every frame: the browser only calls back on the two edges this component
// actually cares about (crossed into view / crossed out of view), and it
// keeps working correctly through anything that moves `.dh-home`'s scroll
// position without firing a `scroll` event on it directly (programmatic
// `scrollTo`, `scrollIntoView` from elsewhere in the tree).
//
// ── The oscillation trap, which full removal makes WORSE, not better ───────
//
// Collapsing hands the hero's height back to `.dh-home`, which can un-scroll
// the very scroll that caused the collapse: the container grows, the browser
// clamps `scrollTop` back toward 0, the marker re-enters view, the hero
// re-expands, the overflow comes back, and it repeats. A real-Chrome run of
// the 66px version surfaced exactly this loop on a near-empty Home, and the
// fix was a positive `rootMargin` (below). Removing the hero ENTIRELY frees
// its full height rather than height-minus-66px, so the band of content
// heights that can bounce is wider now — the static 32px margin alone no
// longer covers it, and `watchScroll` adds a layout check at collapse time:
// it refuses to collapse unless the container will STILL be scrolled past
// the margin after the hero's height is handed back. See the guard inline.
