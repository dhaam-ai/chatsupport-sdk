    //
    //   1. The offline send queue (§9.1). A message typed with no signal is
    //      shown as queued and is then lost by refreshing the tab.
    //   2. Which conversation the customer is IN. `connection.hello` carries
    //      no session id and the server re-resolves the customer to whichever
    //      session is ACTIVE, so a customer reading a RESOLVED conversation
    //      comes back to a different one. Core records the choice under
    //      `chatsdk:<publishableKey>:selectedSession` and re-joins it on
    //      connect — but only if it has somewhere to write it.

    // over a preference the visitor is entitled to.
