# `dhaam_chat_flutter` — Flutter UI for the Dhaam chat widget

The screens, navigation and state container that turn `dhaam_chat`'s streams
into something a customer can look at. This is a **library a host app mounts**,
not an app: `ChatWidget` builds a scoped `Theme` and a `Scaffold` and no
`MaterialApp` of its own, because it is meant to live inside a route, a modal
or a pane that the host owns.

There is a runnable host app in [`example/`](example/). If you want to see this
work rather than read about it, start there — [Running the
example](#running-the-example) below.

---

## The three packages, and why the split is where it is

| Package | What it is | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/dart` — `dhaam_chat` | The WebSocket protocol client. Pure Dart, **no HTTP dependency at all**, no Flutter. Frames, sessions, messages, resume, backoff. | `web_socket_channel` |
| `packages/dart_rest` — `dhaam_chat_rest` | The REST surface the socket deliberately does not speak: history pagination, `POST /upload`, session close/reopen, CSAT, the session picker, identify, `ip-watermark`. Pure Dart, no Flutter. | `dhaam_chat`, `http`, `http_parser` |
| `packages/flutter` — `dhaam_chat_flutter` | **This package.** Widgets, `ChatWidgetCubit`, the remote-config model, the theme layer. | `dhaam_chat`, `dhaam_chat_rest`, `flutter_bloc`, `http`, `url_launcher`, `file_picker`, `mime` |

**The dependency runs one way.** `dhaam_chat` imports nothing from
`dhaam_chat_rest`, and that is asserted by a test
(`packages/dart_rest/test/no_core_import_test.dart`) rather than left as a
convention. Its zero-HTTP boundary is the reason `dhaam_chat_rest` exists as a
separate package instead of living inside it.

This is deliberately **the opposite** of the TypeScript pair, where
`@dhaam-ccrm/rest` imports nothing from `@dhaam-ccrm/core`. That invariant
exists in TS to keep `rest` installable standalone, because `createChatClient`
accepts five independently-substitutable structural seams. Nothing in this
workspace composes a Dart `ChatClient` and a REST layer behind such a function,
so enforcing it here would protect nothing while costing two incompatible
`TokenProvider` types, a duplicated `PublishableKey.parse` (which carries the
secret-key-in-client refusal), and parallel message/attachment hierarchies
needing a translation layer in this package.

### This package does not modify `packages/dart`

`ChatClientAdapter` wraps a `ChatClient` to satisfy `WidgetChatClient` by
delegation, rather than having `ChatClient` implement that interface directly.
That is the boundary: `dhaam_chat` is a protocol client with its own tests and
its own consumers, and a Flutter-shaped interface on it would be this package
reaching upward into a package that must not know Flutter exists. The narrowing
also buys something concrete — `WidgetChatClient` is small enough that every
widget test in this package drives the Cubit with a fake and never opens a
socket.

### Why `Cubit` and not `Bloc`

Both sibling apps (`dh-customer-app-flutter`, `dh-merchant-app-flutter`)
standardise on `flutter_bloc` `^9.1.1`, so that choice was made before this
package existed. Within it, `ChatWidgetCubit` is a `Cubit` for the same reason
`dh-customer-app-flutter`'s own `ConnectivityCubit` is one: the job is mirroring
an external source's streams into widget-renderable state via direct method
calls, not routing a taxonomy of discrete user-typed events through
transformers. `flutter_bloc` is the one pattern; Cubit vs Bloc is a style choice
inside it, not a second pattern introduced alongside it.

### The host publishes appearance; the host cannot override it

`remote-config.ts` supports a host-precedence merge — a host passes appearance
fields that win over the console publish. **That does not carry over here, and
it is a deliberate divergence rather than an omission.** The console publish
remains the single source of truth for appearance on Flutter, which means a
Flutter host **cannot pin an appearance field against a publish**. The
consequence inside the code is that this package never builds the fully-resolved
appearance shape TS's `config.ts` uses: the published, possibly-partial reading
is the only one that exists, which is why `appearance.dart`'s fields are
nullable on one class rather than wrapped in a second `Partial<T>`-shaped type.

---


### The access token is minted by YOUR backend, not by an identity provider

This is the single most common way to get a working setup that will not
connect. `DHAAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` is **not** a Cognito/Auth0/Firebase token, and
not your app's own session JWT. The chat service issues its own short-lived,
scoped token:

```
POST /chat-services/api/v1/tokens
Authorization: Bearer <dhk_test_… secret key>
Content-Type: application/json

{"userId": "...", "name": "..."}
  ->  {"accessToken": "...", "expiresIn": 3600}
```

Called by your **backend**, with your secret key, which must never reach a
client (`openapi/chat-api.yaml:434`, PRD §10.3). Your frontend relays only the
resulting `accessToken`.

Handing the SDK an IdP token instead produces `AUTH_INVALID`, and the client
correctly stops after its auth cap — leaving you looking at
"authentication failed repeatedly" holding a token that is present, unexpired
and visibly a JWT. The example app decodes the token's *shape* (never its
signature) and names this case explicitly in its diagnostics strip.

### Guests need a token too — the profile is what makes a customer

There is no tokenless mode, and this is worth stating because the opposite is
a natural thing to assume: "nobody has logged in, so there is nothing to
authenticate." Every visitor needs a token, and a guest's token identifies an
anonymous **visitor**. The reference refuses a config carrying neither a
`tokenEndpoint` nor a `getToken` and gives the reason outright — "the browser
is never given a secret key, so a token has to come from your own backend"
(`packages/widget/src/config.ts`, `resolveConfig`). A Flutter app is in the
same position: it ships to devices, so it cannot hold the secret key either.

What marks somebody as a **known customer** is a different input entirely:

| | token | `identity.profile` |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | a credential, minted by your backend | data your app already has |
| Guest | **required** | omitted |
| Signed-in customer | **required** | supplied |
| Effect of omitting it | cannot connect at all | treated as a guest — the pre-chat form is asked |

`identity.userId` decides nothing here. Every visitor has one — chat-service
mints one the moment the socket acks — so a gate built on it never fires for
anybody, and `ChatIdentity.isGuest` is deliberately `profile == null` and
nothing else. `packages/widget/src/config.ts` says the same from the other
end: "Supplying it — and only supplying it — is what makes the widget upsert
that user as a Contact via `POST /identify`. `userId` alone does not and must
not, because every guest has one of those too."

The example demonstrates both modes: supply the token, then use the **Visitor**
switch on the host screen. The user id stays the same across it and only the
profile moves, which is the whole point.

### "My signed-in customer is still being asked for their name"

Reported twice, by two different integrators, both of whom had authenticated
the customer properly. Both were right about their end and the widget was
right about its end: `identity` **defaults to `ChatIdentity.guest`**, so a
host that passes a perfectly good customer token and nothing else has, as far
as this package can tell, described an anonymous visitor. It cannot tell
otherwise — the token is opaque to it by design, and the `userId` it can see
belongs to guests too.

The fix is one parameter:

```dart
ChatWidgetCubit(
  client: client,
  // Presence of the PROFILE is the fact. An empty
  // `ChatParticipantProfile()` is enough when that is all you know.
  identity: const ChatIdentity(
    userId: 'cus_1042',
    profile: ChatParticipantProfile(
      name: 'Jordan Rivera',
      email: 'jordan@example.com',
    ),
  ),
);
```

Since it could not be detected, it is at least now **said out loud**: the first
time the widget is about to put the merchant's pre-chat questions in front of a
visitor it considers a guest, it prints a short explanation of the above to the
console (`warnIfAskingAGuestForDetails`, in
`lib/src/ui/pre_chat/guest_pre_chat_warning.dart`).

**All three places those questions can appear are covered**, because the line
hangs off `preChatFieldsToAsk` — the one function that decides which fields to
draw, and the only way any of them can draw any:

* the standalone pre-chat gate, in front of an empty conversation;
* the **new-conversation form**, where the questions are folded in above the
  message box (this is where `startNewConversation()` lands, so it is the
  likeliest one to meet);
* the **out-of-hours offline form**.

The exact terms:

* **Debug builds only.** Not release — and not profile either; the check is
  `kDebugMode`, which is false in both.
* **Once per app run.** Not once per widget and not once per Cubit: three
  surfaces can each ask, a rebuilt `BlocProvider` would ask again, and two of
  the three re-run the gate on every repaint. One line says it once.
* **Nothing about the visitor or the credential.** The message is a `const`
  with no interpolation in it; the package cannot see the token at all.
* **Silent for a host that passed a profile**, and silent for a guest nobody
  asks anything — a merchant who never switched pre-chat on never sees it.

A genuinely guest-only deployment can ignore it: the line names the fix rather
than a fault, and it does not appear at all until the questions actually come
up.


## Running the example

```bash
cd packages/flutter/example
flutter pub get

flutter run \
  --dart-define=DHAAM_WS_URL=wss://chat.your-host.example \
  --dart-define=DHAAM_API_URL=https://api.your-host.example \
  --dart-define=DHAAM_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=dhp_test_yourkey \
  --dart-define=DHAAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your.jwt.here
```

You land on a plain host screen — the merchant's app — with an **Open chat**
button that pushes the panel, plus a diagnostics section showing what the
config fetch and `captureContactInfo` came back with, and which seams this
example was able to wire.

**Nothing is hardcoded and there are no defaults.** Launch it with a key
missing and you get a page naming every key that is missing and the command to
fix it — not a stack trace, and not a socket retrying in backoff forever under
the word "Connecting…". That page is the point: `PublishableKey.parse` throws
and `ChatClient` retries silently, so an unvalidated config fails in whichever
of those two ways is least legible.

### The `--dart-define` keys

| Key | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `DHAAM_WS_URL` | yes | The WebSocket endpoint. `ws://` or `wss://`. Goes to `ChatClient(wsUrl:)`. |
| `DHAAM_API_URL` | yes | The REST **origin**, `http://` or `https://`, **with no path** — `RestClient`, `fetchRemoteConfig` and `fetchIpWatermark` each append `/chat-services/api/v1` themselves. Passing a value that already carries the base path builds a doubled one, and the symptom (every REST call 404s while the socket works fine) is hard to read backwards, so the example refuses it up front. |
| `DHAAM_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | yes | The tenant key, `dhp_live_…` or `dhp_test_…` — **not** `pk_…`, which `PublishableKey.parse` refuses (a bare `pk_test_` is Stripe's shape, and secret scanners report such a key as a Stripe key). Public by design: it identifies a tenant and grants nothing. |
| `DHAAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` | yes | A user JWT for this run — required for **every** visitor, guests included. **See the warning below.** |
| `DHAAM_SESSION_ID` | no | A conversation to open on. Unset lands on Home, which is what a visitor arriving fresh sees. |

`--dart-define` rather than a checked-in constant or a `.env` file: one of these
values is a credential, a constant would put it in git history, and a `.env`
file would need a plugin, an asset entry and a `.gitignore` rule to end up no
safer.

### The static token is an example-only shortcut

`ChatClient` and `RestClient` both take `TokenProvider`, which is
`Future<String> Function()` — a **callback**, never a string. §6.1 requires it
to be structurally impossible to pass a static token in place of one, and in
Dart that is free, because a `String` is not a `Future<String> Function()`.

A real host implements it as a call to **its own backend**, which holds the
secret key and mints a short-lived token via `POST /tokens`. The secret key
never travels to the device, and both clients re-read the callback on every
connect, reauth and request, so a refreshed token is picked up without
restarting anything.

The example closes over a string from `--dart-define` and returns the same
value every time, which means a run outlives its token by exactly as long as the
token had left. That is the one place in `example/seams.dart` where copying the
code verbatim into a production host would be wrong, and it says so in place.

## Host platform entries

The package cannot add these for you; they belong to the app that ships it.

### macOS — `macos/Runner/{DebugProfile,Release}.entitlements`

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
<true/>
```

* **`com.apple.security.network.client`** — required for *any* outbound
  request under App Sandbox. `flutter create` scaffolds only
  `network.server`, which is for the debug VM service, so without this the
  chat socket and every REST call fail with `SocketException: Connection
  failed (OS Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1)`.
  ([Flutter macOS docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/macos/building))
* **`com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only`** — the *User Selected
  File Read* entitlement the attachment picker needs. `file_picker` 11.0.3's
  own `pickFiles` doc states it verbatim: *"Note: This requires the User
  Selected File Read entitlement on macOS."* Read-**only**, not read-write:
  the plugin's own example asks for the wider one because it also demonstrates
  `saveFile`, and this SDK never writes a file back.
* **`com.apple.security.device.audio-input`** — *Audio Input*, which a
  sandboxed app needs before it can open a capture device at all. `record`'s
  own setup notes say to activate it "in debug AND release schemes, or
  directly in `*.entitlements` files", which is why it belongs in **both**
  `DebugProfile.entitlements` and `Release.entitlements` rather than one of
  them. macOS also needs `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in
  `macos/Runner/Info.plist` — the entitlement lets the app open the device,
  the plist string explains the prompt, and missing either one fails
  differently.

### Android — `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

`flutter create` puts `INTERNET` in `src/debug` and `src/profile` only, where
the Flutter tool needs it for hot reload — **not** in `main`. A host that never
adds this line debugs perfectly and then cannot connect at all once shipped.

`RECORD_AUDIO` is declared by `record_android` 1.5.2's own manifest and would
merge in regardless; it is written out because a permission users are asked
for at runtime should be visible in the host's own manifest rather than
arriving invisibly through a transitive dependency.

**Android also needs `minSdk 23`**, in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
defaultConfig {
    minSdk = 23  // not flutter.minSdkVersion, which is 21
}
```

`record_android` declares `minSdk = 23`, so the Flutter 3.24.4 default of 21
fails the manifest merge outright — `uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 21 cannot be
smaller than version 23 declared in library [record_android]`. A build error
rather than a runtime one, which is the good kind, but a real cost this
dependency imposes.

### iOS — `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Record a voice message to send to the support team.</string>
```

`record_ios` links AVFoundation, so this is required of any host that
**builds** against this SDK, not only one that shows the voice button — App
Store review rejects a binary that links the framework without it. Write it
for the person reading the prompt; Apple rejects boilerplate.

`NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` is deliberately **not** required. It
belongs to speech recognition, which this SDK does not do: the voice button
records audio and uploads it for an agent to listen to, and nothing here
transcribes anything. Declaring it would ask a host to justify a capability
to Apple that their binary does not have.

`file_picker` 11.0.3 itself needs no `NSUsageDescription` key on iOS and no
`uses-permission` on Android (its Android manifest carries a `<queries>`
block and nothing else).

### Microphone — not yet

`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` and
`RECORD_AUDIO` are **not** listed here, because there is no voice module:
`lib/src/ui/voice/` does not exist. Add them when it does, and not before —
a permission string for a feature that cannot run is a prompt a customer is
asked to answer for nothing.

---

## What is not wired yet

The parity port is not finished, and the honest list matters more than the
green test count. Everything below is a real gap between this package and
`packages/widget/src/**`, not a rough edge.

**Nothing plays a merchant-supplied chime sound.** `Chime` is mounted and
message arrivals do chime, on `SystemSound.alert`. What has no path is
*replacing* that sound with an asset: the `ChimePlayer` seam exists and
`ChatWidget` takes one, but this package bundles no audio plugin, so a
merchant who wants their own tone needs the host to supply the player.

**`captureContactInfo` still has nowhere to deliver.** `dhaam_chat_rest`
captures user agent, IP, watermark and geolocation through a
`ContactInfoSink`, and the hello frame carries no field for any of it. The
example displays what it captured because displaying it is the only consumer
that exists.

**The consent gate, the offline form, and the hero-header
collapse-oscillation guard are only partly landed.** `lib/src/ui/consent/`
and `lib/src/ui/offline_form/` exist and are mounted; the hero header carries
`kHeroCollapseSlackPx` but the second guard — the layout check read *at
collapse time* — has not been verified end to end. `mergeRemoteConfig`
host-precedence is deliberately not ported (see above). ADR
`docs/adr/0005-flutter-parity-scope.md`, which is to record the full
deliberately-N/A table, is not written yet.

**The session switcher is mounted nowhere** — and neither is
`createSessionSwitcher` in the reference (`session-picker.ts:288` has no call
site in `packages/widget/src`), so this is a faithful port of an unmounted
module rather than a gap. `SessionPickerScreen` looks like superseded code:
Home and Messages read `state.sessionSummaries` directly, expressing the same
`sessions.length > 0` gate as rows rather than as a surface.

`state.sessionSummaries` itself is no longer always empty, and there are now
**three** ways to fill it, each one step more explicit than the last. The page
still comes from outside the socket whichever you pick — `WidgetChatClient` is
the WebSocket slice and `dhaam_chat` cannot list sessions at all — but who
remembers to ask for it has changed.

**Hand over the REST client (recommended).** If you already build a
`dhaam_chat_rest` `RestClient` — for uploads, transcripts, CSAT or
close/reopen — pass it, and the list fills itself:

```dart
ChatWidgetCubit(client: client, rest: rest);
```

That is the entire wiring. The Cubit builds `restSessionSource(rest: rest)`
for itself: the `GET /chat/sessions/customer` call, the field copy from
`RestChatSessionSummary` to `ChatSessionSummary`, and the page size. It adds
nothing to your dependency graph — this package already depends on
`dhaam_chat_rest` directly. `packages/flutter/example/lib/main.dart` is this
route, and it is now the only session-list code that app contains.

**The page size is the route's maximum, deliberately.**
`kSessionListPageSize` is `kSessionSummaryLimitMax`, because this widget
cannot page: Messages renders `state.sessionSummaries` in full and there is no
"load more" behind it, so whatever it asks for is the ceiling on the
conversations a customer can ever reach. Too few silently hides one of their
own conversations with nothing on screen to say so; too many costs a few
kilobytes. To change it, go through `sessionSource` and say so —
`sessionSource: restSessionSource(rest: rest, limit: 5)`. An out-of-range
value is refused with an `ArgumentError` at that call rather than inside the
fetch, because `listSessions` raises `RestValidationException` before sending
anything and routing a caller bug through the error channel would dress it up
as a network failure.

**Or hand over just the fetch.** A host that proxies chat through its own
backend has no `dhaam_chat_rest` client to give, so `sessionSource` takes the
function instead — a `SessionListFetch`, one call, one page:

```dart
ChatWidgetCubit(
  client: client,
  sessionSource: () async => myBackend.conversations(),
);
```

`toChatSessionSummary` is exported from this package for a host still mapping
`RestChatSessionSummary` rows but doing its own fetching. `RestChatSessionSummary`
and `ChatSessionSummary` share `dhaam_chat`'s own ChatStatus/ChatMode/HandledBy,
so it is a field copy with no vocabulary to translate:

```dart
ChatWidgetCubit(
  client: client,
  sessionSource: () async => (await rest.listSessions(limit: 10))
      .map(toChatSessionSummary)
      .toList(growable: false),
);
```

**Passing both `rest` and `sessionSource` is not two fetches.** Exactly one
source is ever built, and `sessionSource` wins. The closure is the more
specific instruction — it says precisely where the conversations come from —
while `rest` is a convenience default for a client you may be holding for
other reasons entirely. Resolving it the other way would let a generic
parameter silently discard hand-written intent and fill the list from the
wrong place, and wrong rows are far harder to notice than no rows.

Both routes get the same triggers, because both end up in the same refresher.
The page is fetched when the widget opens (inside
`connect()`, which `ChatWidget.initState` already calls) and refetched
whenever a session snapshot changes something a list **row** is drawn from —
its id, its status, or the name in its `handledBy`. Routine
live-conversation traffic does not refetch, so this is not a request per
event. A fetch that **fails** is reported to `FlutterError`, leaves the page
already on screen alone rather than emptying it, and does not consume its
trigger: the next snapshot asks again. **The one gap that leaves:** if no
further snapshot ever arrives — a signed-in customer whose conversations are
all closed may get none after the open-time fetch — nothing retries, and the
list stays as it was. Closing that would need a timer this Cubit would then
have to own and cancel; `updateSessionSummaries` remains available as a
host-driven pull-to-refresh in the meantime. An **empty** page is ordinary success,
never an error — `listSessions` answers a guest with `[]`, never a 403, and
turning that into a failure would make "not identified" indistinguishable
from "the lookup failed".

`sessionSource` stays a function rather than becoming a second client
parameter: a host that proxies chat through its own backend fills this list
from something that is not `dhaam_chat_rest` and has no client-shaped thing to
pass, and a closure is also what keeps these paths testable without a network.
It is the same shape as `AttachmentUploader`, `TranscriptEmailer` and
`IssueReporter`.

**Or push your own page.** `ChatWidgetCubit.updateSessionSummaries` is
unchanged and still public, for a host that already fetches this list and
wants to decide when — including as a pull-to-refresh over either of the two
routes above.

A host that wires **none** of the three has a Messages screen with nothing to
draw. That was two integrators' bug report; `sessionSource` was the first
answer to it and `rest` is the second, because a seam nobody fills is
indistinguishable — from the customer's side — from the bug it was added to
fix. A silently empty list looks exactly like a customer who has never
started a conversation.

**The inline report-issue entry point is not ported.** `widget.ts` opens the
report form from two places — the header menu (`:858`, ported) and an inline
button on the seam between the transcript and the composer (`:1401`). Only
the first exists here.

**Voice notes are WAV, where the web widget records WebM or MP4.** `record`'s
stream mode is the only capture path that works on all six platforms without
`dart:io`, and its only universally-available encoder there is `pcm16bits`,
which this package wraps in a WAVE header. The result is uncompressed: about
32 KB per second at 16 kHz mono, so the 25 MiB attachment cap lands at
roughly thirteen minutes rather than the hour a compressed codec would give.
Refused in words at the cap, like any other oversized file.

**Taking `record` imposes three things on every host**, whether or not it
shows the microphone, because the plugin's native code is linked at build
time: `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`; the same key
plus the `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` entitlement in **both**
`macos/Runner/*.entitlements`; and `RECORD_AUDIO` with **`minSdk 23`** on
Android — the Flutter 3.24.4 default of 21 fails the manifest merge outright.
`packages/flutter/example/` carries exactly these entries and no invented
ones. `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` is deliberately **not** among
them: this SDK records audio and never transcribes it, so declaring it would
ask a host to justify a capability their binary does not have.

### Deliberately not ported, and not coming

`embed.ts` (script-tag entry), `attributes.ts` (`data-*` → config — it cannot
even express `identity.profile`), `singleton.ts` (one widget per page across
separately-evaluated bundle copies; pub guarantees one copy, and multi-instance
is the *normal* case in Flutter), `ui/dom.ts`, `ui/focus.ts`,
`ui/platform-color.ts` (it samples the **host page's** computed colours, and
there is no host page), `ui/presentation.ts`, `ui/styles.ts`, `ui/root.ts`, and
the launcher/auto-open/**exit-intent** cluster. Exit-intent is structurally
impossible — it fires on a pointer leaving the document toward *browser
chrome* — and the widget already degrades it to `'never'` on touch devices, so
omitting it is behaviourally identical to the web widget on the same class of
device. Those fields are parsed and exposed; nothing acts on them.

---

## Tests

```bash
cd packages/flutter && flutter test
```

`packages/flutter/example` has its own small suite (`flutter test` from inside
`example/`) covering the one behaviour there whose failure mode is a runtime
one: an unset `--dart-define` produces a page rather than a crash.

`dart format` is **not** clean on this package and that is known: it is written
at a wider line length than the formatter's fixed 80 columns, and the one-shot
reformat is deliberately deferred so it does not collide with in-flight work.
(`dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test` reports 43 of 148
files changed as of this writing — a figure worth re-measuring rather than
quoting, which is why the command is here and the number is parenthetical.) The CI job runs `analyze --fatal-infos`
and `test` here, and keeps its format gate on `packages/dart` and
`packages/dart_rest`, which are both clean.
