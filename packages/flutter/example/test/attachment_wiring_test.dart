/// Whether this app's wiring actually produces a paperclip.
///
/// ── The reported bug, and what was actually wrong with it ────────────────
///
/// "File upload / attachments do not appear." The triage said the example
/// constructs no `AttachmentDraftController`, so the button is hidden. That is
/// not how the seam works, and building one here would have been the wrong
/// fix:
///
///  * `ChatWidgetCubit` takes the two SEAMS — `attachmentUploader` and
///    `attachmentPicker` — and builds the controller itself, once per
///    composer, through `createAttachmentDraft`. A draft is one composer's
///    pending file and has to die with it, so a host-built one shared across
///    conversations would let a file picked in one reappear in the next.
///  * `ConversationScreen` already calls that factory and already passes the
///    answer to `Composer(attachments:)`.
///  * and `main.dart` already passes `attachmentUploader:`.
///
/// So the chain is whole, and the honest thing to add is not a controller but
/// the test that would notice if the one line holding the chain together were
/// removed. `attachmentUploader` is optional and its absence is silent by
/// design — "off, not broken" — which is exactly the property that lets a
/// paperclip disappear without a single test going red.
///
/// What remains, and is not this app's to fix: the button is ALSO gated on
/// `RemoteConfig.fileUploads`, which is the merchant's switch and defaults to
/// **false** on a `Composer` built before the config lands. A tenant with
/// uploads turned off correctly shows no paperclip. The host screen names the
/// effective value for that reason.
