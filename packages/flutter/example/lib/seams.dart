/// The seams `dhaam_chat_flutter` deliberately leaves injectable, filled in
/// with the real implementations a host is expected to supply.
///
/// ── Why this file is the point of the example ────────────────────────────
///
/// Every one of these is a function type or a one-method interface that the
/// package takes as a parameter rather than constructing for itself, so that
/// its own tests can pass a closure and never touch a platform channel or a
/// network. That property is worth having and it has a cost: not one of the
/// package's tests ever exercises the REAL implementations together. This
/// file is the first place they meet.
///
/// The count used to be written out here and had drifted — it said 930 against
/// a suite of 1245 — so it is not written out any more. A number nobody
/// reruns is a number that is wrong, and this file's whole argument is that a
/// claim which is not rechecked stops being true quietly.
///
/// Each declaration below is CONSTRUCTED, not described. If
/// `filePickerAttachmentPicker` ever stops satisfying `AttachmentPicker`, or
/// `RestClient.uploadAttachment` changes shape, this file stops compiling —
/// which is the whole reason to write the recipe as code rather than as a
/// paragraph in the README.
///
/// ── Everything here is now passed to something ───────────────────────────
///
/// This header used to say that two of these had nowhere to go. Both
/// statements are now out of date, and in different ways.
///
/// [exampleChime] was described as unreachable because "nothing inside the
/// package constructs one". That was wrong when it was written and stayed
/// wrong: `ChatWidget` has always taken an optional `chime`
/// (`chat_widget.dart:71`, `widget.chime ?? Chime()`), so the seam was open
/// the whole time and this app simply did not use it. It does now — which is
/// the entire argument for keeping this panel honest, since a "not wired"
/// row nobody rechecks reads as a missing feature rather than as a missing
/// line in an example.
///
/// The session list was a third case, and a different one again: the seam is
/// `ChatWidgetCubit.updateSessionSummaries`, and nothing called it, so the
/// Messages screen was empty on every run. That fetch does not live in this
/// file because it is not a closure the package takes — it is a page a host
/// goes and gets. It lives in `session_list.dart`, and the panel below it
/// reports on it.
///
/// [exampleAttachmentDraft] was in that list for a real reason and no longer
/// is — not
/// because it is now passed, but because the shape it demonstrated was
/// wrong. `ChatWidgetCubit` takes the two SEAMS (`attachmentUploader`,
/// `attachmentPicker`) and builds the draft controller per composer itself,
/// because a draft is one composer's pending file and must die with it. So
/// `main.dart` passes [exampleAttachmentUploader] directly and the assembled
/// controller below exists only as compile-time proof that the picker and the
/// uploader fit each other.

/// This example does not add one, for a reason that is specific rather than

/// on iOS, macOS and Android, and this app's platform files carry exactly the
/// entries the SDK's own plugins documented and no invented ones. Adding four
/// permission declarations to demonstrate a value that has nowhere to go (see
/// [seamReports] on `captureContactInfo`) would be inventing host requirements
/// to exercise a dead path.
