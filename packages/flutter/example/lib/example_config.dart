/// Everything this example needs from the outside world, read from
/// `--dart-define` and validated before a single socket is opened.
///
/// ── Why `--dart-define` and not a `.env` file or a constant ──────────────
///
/// Three of the four values below are deployment facts and one of them
/// (`DHAAM_ACCESS_TOKEN`) is a credential. A checked-in constant would put a
/// credential in git history, and a `.env` file would need a plugin, an asset
/// entry and a `.gitignore` rule to be no safer. `--dart-define` keeps every
/// one of them on the command line that launches the build and out of the
/// repository entirely.
///
/// **There are no defaults.** Every key below defaults to the empty string,
/// which this file then reports as missing. A plausible-looking placeholder —
/// `https://chat.example.com`, `pk_test_abc123` — would be worse than no
/// default at all: the app would start, the socket would fail somewhere deep
/// in reconnect backoff, and the person testing by hand would be debugging a
/// value nobody typed.
///
/// ── The failure mode this file exists to prevent ─────────────────────────
///
/// `PublishableKey.parse` throws, `Uri.parse` throws, and `ChatClient` opens a
/// socket that retries with backoff rather than reporting anything. Left
/// alone, an unset key is either a red screen with a Dart stack trace or an
/// app that says "Connecting…" forever. Both are the same bug — the
/// configuration error is never named. So the whole configuration is resolved
/// and validated ONCE, synchronously, before `runApp`'s tree is built, and a
/// failure becomes a page that names the missing keys.
