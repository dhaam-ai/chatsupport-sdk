/// `session_actions.dart` describes this class before it existed: "this is the
/// seam, and `dhaam_chat_rest`'s `RestClient` is the adapter a host writes
/// over it — four methods, each a direct delegation." That is what this is.
/// It is four methods and no logic, which is the point — every rule that could
/// be got wrong (the 404/405 classification, the two-round-trip read-back, the
/// converged reopen id) already lives in the package below.
///
/// ── Why the host writes it and the package does not ──────────────────────
///
/// `dhaam_chat_flutter` now depends on `dhaam_chat_rest` (orchestrator
/// decision D22), so it COULD ship this class. It does not, and the seam's own
/// doc gives the reason: a host that already proxies chat through its own
/// backend has a different transport and still wants these screens. The
/// interface is what makes that host possible; this class is what makes the
/// ordinary host's job four lines.
