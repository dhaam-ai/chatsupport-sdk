/// The ⋯ menu, mounted — and the whole End → rating chain behind it.
///
/// `test/ui/header/header_menu_test.dart` drives [HeaderMenu] with literal
/// props and proves every row's own rule. It passed while both of the bugs
/// this file exists for were live in a real app, because neither bug is in
/// the widget: they are in what the mount hands it, and in whether the mount
/// happens at all. So every case here goes through [ChatWidget] and a real
/// [ChatWidgetCubit], and touches the menu the way a customer does.
///
/// Two things are pinned:
///
///  1. **The header follows the conversation, not the back history.** It was
///     gated on `state.canGoBack`, which is empty for a host that opens the
///     panel directly on a conversation — so the bar, and with it the ⋯ menu,
///     never mounted and "End conversation" was unreachable however live the
///     conversation was.
///  2. **The mute row is offered only when the merchant published a chime.**
///     `RemoteConfig.sound` defaults to false and this tenant sends
///     `behaviour: {}`, so muting and unmuting changed nothing that could be
///     heard — the one row in this menu that was offered without being
///     backed.
