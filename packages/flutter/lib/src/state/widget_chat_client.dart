/// ── Why this exists instead of depending on ChatClient directly ─────────
///
/// `ChatClient`'s real surface is wider than any one screen needs — presence,
/// `leaveSession`, `dispose`, `stopTyping` — and
/// constructing a real one for a test means driving a full §7/§8 handshake
/// through a fake socket. `dhaam_chat`'s OWN test suite does exactly that
/// (`test/fakes.dart`'s `FakeSocket` + `FakeScheduler`), and that is the
/// right tool for testing the PROTOCOL. It is the wrong tool for testing
/// "does this Cubit correctly merge two `ChatMessage`s that share an id" —
/// that question has nothing to do with envelope encoding or the connect
/// handshake. Narrowing to what this layer actually calls is what lets
/// `ChatWidgetCubit` be tested against a five-line fake instead of a
/// simulated WebSocket.
///
/// This is not a hypothetical seam: [ChatClientAdapter] below is the real
/// implementation (wrapping a live [ChatClient] by delegation) and the test
/// suite's fake is the second — codebase-design's "two adapters means a
/// real one."

  /// CUSTOMER-ASSERTED contact on the session (fill-empty only, marked
  /// `source: 'pre_chat'`). Without it the pre-chat answers reach the agent
  /// as text and nothing else — the lines are read, the contact is never
  /// created. The reference sends both halves in one frame
  /// (`widget.ts`'s `sendPreChatDetails`) and so does this.

  /// [attachment] is the uploaded file this message announces — the url,

  /// what kind of message it therefore is. Both ride on the frame, so a send
  /// held for the connection to come back replays them unchanged.
  ///
  /// ── Why these two arrived together ───────────────────────────────────
  ///
  /// `ChatClient.sendMessage` has accepted both since D26 and this interface
  /// exposed neither, which meant the whole attachment path — the paperclip,
  /// the 25 MiB refusal, the draft bar, `POST /upload`, all of it tested —
  /// ended at a callback holding metadata with nowhere to put it. A customer
  /// could pick a file, watch it upload, and send a message that mentioned
  /// no file at all.
  ///
  /// They arrive as a pair rather than one at a time because §12.10's shape
  /// needs both at once: an attachment message carries the URL as its
  /// `content` AND a [MessageType] derived from the media type. An
  /// `attachment` exposed without a `type` would put an image on the wire
  /// as `TEXT`, which no other client in this system produces — see
  /// `ChatWidgetCubit.sendAttachment`, the one caller that passes them.
  ///
  /// Null omits the attachment key entirely, exactly as [metadata] does, and
  /// [type] defaults to what every existing caller already sends, so no
  /// existing caller changes behaviour.

  ///
  /// ── Why there is no `stopTyping` beside it ──────────────────────────────
  ///
  /// Not an oversight and not asymmetry for its own sake. `ChatClient` pairs
  /// nothing with `stopTyping`: both methods are unmediated single-frame
  /// sends, with no debounce, no auto-stop timer and no coordinator holding
  /// state that a missing stop would leave unbalanced — unlike the TypeScript
  /// core, where both go through `presenceCoordinator.typing`. And the
  /// reference widget, which is what this layer ports, **never calls
  /// `stopTyping` at all** (`grep -rn stopTyping packages/widget/src` is
  /// empty): the remote indicator clears on the receiver's own timeout, not
  /// on a frame from here.
  ///
  /// So exposing it would add a member with no producer and no consumer —
  /// the same emptiness `TicketLinked` wore before it was surfaced, and the
  /// same emptiness [retry] wore while `MessageDelivery` could not answer for
  /// it. This interface's whole purpose is to be what this layer actually

  /// — the customer moved to another active conversation, and nobody
  /// resolved this one. Both readings arrive as the same `ChatStatus.closed`,
  /// so a widget with only the snapshot has to guess, and guessing wrong
  /// puts a satisfaction survey and an "This conversation has ended" footer
  /// over a conversation that is merely on hold.

  /// ── What this stream can and cannot tell you ────────────────────────────

  /// `ChatClient` decodes `agent.joined` and `agent.left` through the SAME
  /// [HandledBy] decoder onto the SAME stream, so an event says WHO but not
  /// WHETHER they arrived or left. That is deliberate on its side — one
  /// canonical identity shape, so a header and a toast can never disagree
  /// about a name — but it means this stream alone cannot drive an identity
  /// header: reading an `agent.left` as an arrival would put the departed
  /// agent's name back on the header at the moment they walked away.
  ///
  /// The authority for "who is handling this conversation" is therefore
  /// [SessionSnapshot.status] + [SessionSnapshot.handledBy], read through
  /// `isHandledByCurrent` — which is exactly what the reference does too
  /// (`widget.ts` folds both frames into its session state and the header
  /// renders from that, never from the frames). Use this stream for things
  /// that are about the EVENT rather than the state: a chime, a toast.

  /// Replays ONE failed send under its original envelope id (§9.3, D1).
  ///
  /// Not [retryNow], which is the connection's backoff and says nothing about
  /// any particular message. Wiring a per-message Retry button to that one
  /// would be a control that cannot do what its label says.
  ///
  /// ── Why this returns the outcome instead of a `bool` or nothing ────────
  ///
  /// Because a refusal is an expected result a caller has to be able to tell
  /// apart, and the three reasons are not interchangeable.
  /// [RetryRefusalReason.notRetryable] should never be seen by a host that
  /// gates its button on [MessageFailed.retryable] — the same flag rides on
  /// the message. [RetryRefusalReason.disconnected] cannot be predicted that
  /// way at all: a connection can drop between drawing the button and the
  /// press, and "it failed again" is the wrong thing to say about an attempt
  /// that never left the device.
