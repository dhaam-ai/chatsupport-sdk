/// The longest a recoverable outage is allowed to look stuck.

/// `dhaam_chat`'s full-jitter backoff (§8.2) is right about servers and wrong
/// about phones. Its whole job is to protect a recovering server from every
/// client it dropped reconnecting in lockstep, and it does that by growing the
/// delay to a 30-second cap. But the commonest outage a chat widget actually
/// sees is not a server restart — it is one handset losing signal for ninety
/// seconds. That handset is not part of a thundering herd, and making it wait
/// out a 30-second delay after its signal is back is how "it just says
/// Connecting…" gets reported.
///
/// Three seconds is the ceiling this puts on that wait. It does not replace
/// backoff: the client's early attempts are all faster than this (500ms, 1s,
/// 2s), so for the first several failures this timer never wins. It only bites
/// once the curve has climbed past it, which is exactly the regime where one
/// device's retry rate is nobody's problem.
