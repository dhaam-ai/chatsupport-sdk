/// One state snapshot in, one render out. The whole of `message-list.ts`'s

/// ── Why this is one call and not six helpers the view stitches together ──
///
/// Every rule the transcript has to get right — the §12.10 placeholder, the
/// tick that may only come from [deriveTickState], `retryable` never
/// re-derived, the author name on the first bubble of a run against the
/// avatar on every row, the remembered bot name, the announce watermark —
/// interacts with at least one other. Handing the view six functions and a
/// loop is handing it six chances to combine them differently from the next
/// caller. [present] is the whole interface: the view receives rows and
/// draws them.
///
/// It is also what makes the rules assertable without pumping a widget.
///
/// ── The announce discipline ─────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// Three filters, each removing a real annoyance: our own messages are never
/// announced (the user wrote them), nothing is announced on the first state
/// seen (that is history loading, and announcing forty messages on open is
/// hostile), and a message already announced is never repeated when an
/// unrelated field on it changes — which is why the watermark is the message
/// ID rather than the array length, since a tick update does not lengthen
/// the array but a retry-then-succeed does reorder it.
