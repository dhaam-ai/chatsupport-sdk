///
/// `styles.ts` ends its `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block with
/// `.dh-typing-dot { animation: none; }` — the dots hold still and the
/// bubble stays. Flutter's equivalent of that query is
/// `MediaQueryData.disableAnimations`, which the framework populates from
/// `PlatformDispatcher.accessibilityFeatures`
/// (flutter/lib/src/widgets/media_query.dart, Flutter 3.24.4), so the port
/// is one read rather than a platform channel. The bubble is deliberately
/// NOT hidden in that case: a customer who asked for less motion still
/// needs to know somebody is replying.

/// in the same order and at the same sizes: [MessageAvatar], a 6px gap, and
/// a `surfaceContainerHighest` bubble at radius 16 (see [MessageBubbleRow],
/// which is the definition those numbers are copied from). That is what
/// makes it read as "the next message, being written" rather than as a
/// status label — a bubble that sits 30px to the left of every bubble above
/// it reads as a footer, whichever dots are inside it.
///
/// This is one deliberate step past `styles.ts`, where `.dh-typing` is a
/// bare `align-self: flex-start` box with no `.dh-msg-avatar` beside it.
/// The DOM row and this row indent their bubbles by the avatar's width, so
/// in both ports an avatar-less typing bubble hangs out of the column the
/// transcript established; Flutter is simply where it was noticed.
///
/// Deliberately not a live region — a typing indicator that announces itself
/// interrupts the message the customer is actually reading, and it can flap
/// several times a second. [label] is the only channel that can say WHO; it
/// used to be the fixed word "Agent", which named a human on a session being
