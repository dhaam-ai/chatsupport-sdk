/// ── Every item here does something ───────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The reference design shows five, and all five are backed by something real
/// before they were built. That check is the point of this comment, because
/// the alternative — a menu item that looks like a feature and does nothing —
/// is a promise the product breaks in front of the customer, and it is the
/// trap this codebase has already documented twice (the emailed transcript
/// before its route existed; edit/delete, which have no protocol frame and
/// were therefore left out of the per-message menu).
///
///   Mute / Unmute notifications → silences the local chime (`chime.dart`),
///                         or gives it back. Per DEVICE, not per tenant: it
///                         is this visitor's preference about noise on their
///                         own machine. The label states the ACTION and
///                         therefore flips — see [muteLabel].
///   Start new conversation → the new-conversation flow.
///   End conversation    → `POST /chat/sessions/:id/close`, customer-owned.
///   Report an issue     → `report_issue_form.dart`, filing a real ticket.
///   Privacy             → `RemoteConfig.privacyUrl`. HIDDEN when the
///                         merchant has not published one, rather than
///                         linking nowhere.
///
/// ── Hidden, never disabled ───────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// An unbacked item is absent from [headerMenuEntries] entirely. A disabled
/// row still occupies the menu and still reads as a feature the customer is
/// somehow not allowed to use, which invites them to go looking for the
/// permission they are missing. There is no permission; the thing simply is
/// not offered here.
///
/// ── What did NOT port from `header-menu.test.ts` ─────────────────────────
///
/// That file's `outside-dismiss vs shadow retargeting` block — four of its
/// seven cases — is about a bug with no Flutter analogue. There, the menu's
/// dismiss listener lives on the `document`, outside the shadow tree, so a
/// press on the menu's own item is RETARGETED to the shadow host, looks
/// "outside", and closes the menu between pointerdown and pointerup —
/// swallowing the click. Flutter's menus are routes with their own modal
/// barrier: there is no shadow boundary, no retargeting, and the framework
/// owns the barrier press. Those cases are in the same category the parity
/// plan already names for `focus.test.ts` and `presentation.test.ts` — DOM
/// idioms that do not transfer. The dismissal BEHAVIOUR is still asserted in
/// `header_menu_test.dart`, through the framework rather than around it.

/// notifications" forever with only the bell glyph changing, which left the
/// one word that says what pressing it does permanently lying.
///
/// A flipping action label cannot coexist with checkbox semantics. Once
/// muted, `role="menuitemcheckbox"` + `aria-checked` announces "Unmute
/// notifications, checked" — which asserts the OPPOSITE of what the control
/// will do. The escape (keep the checkbox, pin a stable accessible name) is
/// worse: the accessible name would no longer contain the visible label,
/// which is a WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name) failure, and it leaves a
/// voice-control user saying "unmute notifications" at a control the platform
/// knows only as "mute notifications".

/// In Flutter that means: no `Semantics(checked:)`, no [CheckboxListTile], no
/// [Semantics] label override anywhere on this row. The visible [Text] IS the
/// accessible name, and it is this string. Its state stays legible from the
/// label itself and from the struck-through bell beside it.
