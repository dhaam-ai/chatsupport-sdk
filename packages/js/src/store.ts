// createChatStore — the whole of this binding's reactivity mapping.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What replaces a re-render
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// React maps core's store onto `useSyncExternalStore`; Vue onto refs; Angular
// onto signals. There is no framework here, so the notification primitive is
// the smallest thing that every one of those could itself be built on: a
// plain callback, invoked synchronously, returning an idempotent unsubscribe.
//
// Not an `EventTarget`: it would box every payload in a `CustomEvent`
// (allocation per notification, `detail` typed as `any`), it is a DOM-family
// global this package has deliberately excluded (tsconfig.json drops `DOM`
// precisely so SSR/Node imports stay provable rather than aspirational), and
// it offers no place to hang per-subscriber selector caching — which is the
// one job this file actually has. Not a custom Observable either: an
// Observable's value is its subscription protocol, and a widget that wants
// one can wrap a callback in three lines, whereas a widget that does not want
// one cannot unship it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why selector caching is per subscription, not per store
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// §6.4 assigns field-level diffing to bindings: "core only guarantees the
// full, consistent snapshot is available on every notification; it does not
// do field-level diffing itself." So every subscription keeps `{raw,
// selected}` — the last `ChatState` it saw and the value it derived from it.
// Two cheap gates follow, in order:
//
//   1. `raw === state` — core keeps `getState()` reference-identical while
//      nothing changed, so an unchanged snapshot skips the selector entirely.
//   2. `isEqual(selected, next)` — a composite selector builds a new object
//      every call by construction; without this gate every subscriber fires
//      on every state change, which is the exact failure this package exists
//      to prevent. On a miss the OLD reference is kept, so a downstream
//      identity check (a framework's, or a widget's own `if (next === prev)`)
//      also sees "unchanged".
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Thin means thin
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// No reconnect, backoff, dedup, ordering, queueing, token refresh, watermark
// or tick logic lives here. All of it is core's, tested there. `messages` is
// passed through in the order core hands it over — never re-sorted — and the
// tick comes from core's `deriveTickStateFromState`, never from a local
// reimplementation.
